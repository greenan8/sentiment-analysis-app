1,"Love this dress!  its sooo pretty.  i happened to find it in a store, and im glad i did bc i never would have ordered it online bc its petite.  i bought a petite and am 58.  i love the length on me- hits just a little below the knee.  would definitely be a true midi on someone who is truly petite.",Positive
2,"I had such high hopes for this dress and really wanted it to work for me. i initially ordered the petite small (my usual size) but i found this to be outrageously small. so small in fact that i could not zip it up! i reordered it in petite medium, which was just ok. overall, the top half was comfortable and fit nicely, but the bottom half had a very tight under layer and several somewhat cheap (net) over layers. imo, a major design flaw was the net over layer sewn directly into the zipper - it c",Negative
5,"I love tracy reese dresses, but this one is not for the very petite. i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand. this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress. the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame. not a stranger to alterations, shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment. i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me. i returned this dress.",Negative
10,Dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs. i ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight! the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric. pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year! needless to say it will be going back.,Negative
11,This dress is perfection! so pretty and flattering.,Positive
17,Took a chance on this blouse and so glad i did. i wasnt crazy about how the blouse is photographed on the model. i paired it whit white pants and it worked perfectly. crisp and clean is how i would describe it. launders well. fits great. drape is perfect. wear tucked in or out - cant go wrong.,Positive
18,"A flattering, super cozy coat.  will work well for cold, dry days and will look good with jeans or a dressier outfit.  i am 5 5, about 135 and the small fits great.",Positive
22,"First of all, this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i wouldnt have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me.

second of all, the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath.

not at all what is looks like or is described as. sadly will be returning, but im sure i will find something to exchange it for!",Negative
25,"Loved the material, but i didnt really look at how long the dress was before i purchased both a large and a medium. im 55 and there was atleast 5 of material at my feet. the gaps in the front are much wider than they look. felt like the dress just fell flat. both were returned. im usually a large and the med fit better. 36d 30 in jeans",Negative
26,I have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive. this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat. the sleeves are very wide (although long). as a light weight fall coat the sleeves dont need to be as wide because you wouldnt be layerng too much underneath. the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit. i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh,Negative
28,I have several of goodhyouman shirts and i get so many compliments on them. especially the one that says forehead kisses are underrated. dont hesitate. buy this shirt. you wont be sorry.....,Positive
32,These pants are even better in person. the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned.,Positive
33,"I ordered this 3 months ago, and it finally came off back order. a huge disappointment. the fit wasn&#39;t so much the issue for me. the quality of the wool is subpar. someone else mentioned a &quot;felted wool&quot;...i guess, is that what you call it?  it does literally feel like felt! super thin, itchy, doesn&#39;t drape very well, and feels cheap (made in china). i got it on sale, but still not worth what i paid. definitely going back.",Negative
37,"Just ordered this in a small for me (56, 135, size 4) and medium for my mom (53, 130, size 8) and it is gorgeous - beautifully draped, all the weight/warmth ill need for houston fall and winter, looks polished snapped or unsnapped. age-appropriate for both my mom (60s) and myself (30s). will look amazing with skinny jeans or leggings. we ordered the gray which is true to the photos.",Positive
42,"This poncho is so cute i love the plaid check design, the colors look like sorbet & cream and it will pair well with a turtleneck and jeans or pencil skirt and heels. i love this look for fall and it can roll right into spring. great buy!!",Positive
46,I love this top. i wear it all the time.  the problem is that you can tell i wear it all the time as the fabric has started to fade.  id still recommend it as it is so comfortable.,Positive
47,"Very comfortable, material is good, cut out on sleeves flattering",Positive
48,"This sweater is perfect for fall...its roomy, warm, super comfy and the color really pops.",Positive
51,"I absolutely love this bib tee! its probably my favorite retailer purchase of all time. im 57, 140 pounds and the small was a perfect fit for me. i typically wear either a s or m tops.",Positive
53,"Very soft and comfortable. the shirt has an unusual, asymmetrical seam that appears along the front, right-hand side of the garment. (the model is positioned so that you cant see this detail from the picture. i attached a picture that includes the front seam.) i actually like the seam - it creates more visual interest, and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly. the cowl neck is very well done - there are two layers that form the cowl, and ive found that it means wardrobe malfun",Positive
55,This is an adorable top that i find to be extremely comfortable. i dont usually buy prints but this one is so feminine and looks great with dark wash jeans. i am a 36d and the medium was a perfect fit.,Positive
56,"I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. its soft and fits okay, but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store, i would have passed over it. however, i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. its comfortable so thats a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies, though!",Negative
57,This tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed. but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it.,Negative
60,"This dress is simply beautiful and stunning. it is so figure flattering and i cant wait to wear it. size small worked for me, and since im tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me. i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail.",Positive
61,"3 tags sewn in, 2 small (about 1 long) and 1 huge (about 2 x 3). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however, this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasnt so itchy!",Negative
62,I recently got this on sale after looking at it forever on my wish list. im so happy with it. its very comfortable and just long enough for my torso (53). the pattern on the front is very flattering.,Positive
67,"Love this top! i kept eyeing it online and wavering on size, since my post-baby body is a little wonky. i went with the xsp, and miraculously, it works perfectly! so, i would say it does run just a little large..... i love the length, and usually do not go with petite sizes at retailer because i like the longer lengths of the regular. but this is perfect on me, and there is give up top, so it looks lovely. and it is very soft and comfortable. this will be a go-to top this season!",Positive
68,"I really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person. it is soft and the patter is okay in person. the neckline is higher than i am used to. also, there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top. it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on. unfortunately i had to return this item...",Negative
69,"I really wanted this to work. alas, it had a strange fit for me. the straps would not stay up, and it had a weird fit under the breast. it worked standing up, but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders. the fabric was beautiful! and i loved that it had pockets.",Negative
71,"Why do designers keep making crop tops??!! i cant imagine this would be flattering on anyone, especially someone average height and well endowed on top. i looked like a football player. the pattern and fabric are gorgeous, so if you are like 4 tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 6-8 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top. such a weird cut. there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s",Negative
77,"The zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it. very disappointing since i love the design. im actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger, but annoying that its come to that.",Negative
85,"I was really hoping to like this, but it did not look the way it does on the model, at least not on me. the sharkbite hem is much more pronounced and looser. the one in the photo looks like it was pinned back. i am 58 and usually wear a medium or large. i got a medium and there was a lot more material on the bottom half than the photo shows. it made me look bigger and was not flattering. material has a nice weave but its thin and delicate. i bought the (holly) deep olive and the blue. colors",Negative
88,"Really cute piece, but its huge. i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering. returning.",Negative
95,"Purchased this top online, and when i received it was very pleased.
it has and elegant cut and yet is a casual fabric.
love that the sleeves run longer......ads to the overall look.
also loved the v neckline.........enhances the feel of the overall style.
with various necklaces this top has limitless options!
the color states moss....which i usually think of as greenish brown......i found it to be more of a taupe.
would have liked it to have a green tones, however it is still a fantastic f",Positive
96,"I usually wear a medium and bought a small. it fit ok, but had no shape and was not flattering. i love baby doll dresses and tops, but this was a tent. my daughter saw me try it on and said thats a piece of tablecloth. its going back.",Negative
97,"I was very excited to order this top in red xs. so cute, but it was huge, shapeless and support thin! it had to go back. i shouldve looked at other reviews.",Negative
99,"I am in need of easy comfortable tops for everyday wear. i bought this top mostly because of the cute buttons. when i received it, it looked exactly as it does in the picture online, however, the buttons kept slipping out of their homes because the holes were slightly too big. the shirt fit but was just a tad snug near the upper arms, which would stretch and loosen up throughout the day. its definitely a comfortable shirt, but it felt more like a pajama top. its going back.",Negative
103,The fabric felt cheap and i didnt find it to be a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.,Negative
104,"Runs big and looked unflattering. i am petite, might work on someone taller.",Negative
110,This is so thin and poor quality. especially for the price. it felt like a thin pajama top. the buttons are terrible little shell buttons. this could not have been returned faster.,Negative
112,"I read the first review on this and ordered both a small and a medium as i thought this would run small. i have to totally disagree with the reviewer! i find that this top runs true to size or even generous! the sky color is so pretty and this top can be dressed up with some nice heels and a necklace or it can be comfy casual! i usually wear a small in hh brand and this one was true to fit (52, broad shoulders, 120 lb)",Positive
113,This dress is comfortable and stylish at the same time. it runs true to size. im 51 113 lbs and got the xs petite. wore it once so far for a few hours and got a few compliments on it!,Positive
114,"The design/shape of the dress are quite flattering, flirty and feminine. but.... there is no way that the dress i received is new. the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area. there is no tag... the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp, stiff or new. i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received. undoubtedly this one is going back.

dear retailer - please make sure that you do not send pre-owend clothing articles to",Negative
118,"First, the fabric is beautiful and lovely for spring and summer. i really wanted to like this top, but the fitting is so awkward for me. i typically where a 0/xs, and sized up in the shirt to a size 2. it was very tight and pulled funny across the chest (size 32/a). i also found the cut at the shoulders very narrow (need a strapless bra) and made it look unflattering overall. had to return this one back to the store.",Negative
120,"The perfect striped t-shirt, and the cute little buttons down the front are a wonderful accent with each one being different. i love it!",Positive
122,"This is a great pull over dress that can easily be dressed to wear to work, to a bbq, or to happy hour. i have a large chest which sometimes makes this fit look like a tent but this fabric drapes nicely. the only thing i would note is the neckline was slightly higher on me than for the model.",Positive
124,"I was so excited to try out this top since it was such a bargain and neutral. unfortunately, the shape is a line and accentuates the hip area a bit more than i find flattering. so, it will be returned.",Negative
127,"This coat is beautiful! i love the color and the design. it definitely runs a little large. i usually wear a small or a zero and i can wear a small wth a large sweater underneath no problem. i might have wanted an extra small but i just stuck with the small because i needed the coat already. the vest keeps it warm, but the sleeves arent lined so its cold unless you have a nice sweater underneath it if youre going to be in cold weather.",Positive
133,"I love this vest! there are so many ways to style it...open or tied closed, over a dress or with a tshirt and jeans. i get compliments every time i wear it. its soft and light enough to add interest to an outfit without being too heavy/hot to wear all day.",Positive
139,"The silhouette and length of this skirt and length are flattering, classic and comfortable! the colors and weight of this skirt make it versatile - could be worn year-round (so long as its not 100 degrees out - there is a bit of weight to it). its one of my favorite pieces in my closet. can be styled 20 different ways. pair with a higher-end tee, tank, denim jacket or body-hugging sweater. i sized down.",Positive
144,"My firned tried this on and her first comment was take it off, it is scratchy, so i didnt bother trying it on. it is, however, beautiful, if you are not sensitive to scratchy material.
fit was true to size.",Negative
149,"This skirt is wonderful! the price point seems a bit high for the average office gal, but the quality is impeccable. i really enjoy looking at myself in the mirror when wearing this skirt. it can be dressed up, dressed down, worn during all seasons. the design/pattern is artsy and whimsical without being too out-there (unless you want it to be, of course!). the fit is true to size, and the delicate details are just lovely.",Positive
150,"Like other reviewers noted, the pics dont do this skirt justice. it is truly beautiful with an intricate lace pattern and rich colors. cant wait to wear this to work!",Positive
152,"Not keeping this one. the fabric is a bit tacky-looking in person, the cut is odd and its just not me. fit is fine and there are snaps to keep the neckline flat and shaped, the colors are as shown and it is a good length (falls to top of hip). i simply did not like it. too metallic looking maybe...",Negative
155,This top is so much better in person. i do not agree with some of the other reviews about the fabric being scratchy. it is not and i have sensitive skin. i love this top and have got lots of compliments.,Positive
157,So  disappointed that no where in the limiting did it mention this suit is australian in size!! i ordered the 10 (im usually an 8 but that was sold out) and the suit arrives and doesnt even fir over my hips. -- the label clearly says 10 australian us 6!  gutted that i have to return this suit because of this sizing issue.  the suit looks to be well made and the design is adorable of it only for.,Negative
161,"The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit, sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however, that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy,, stiff, and, frankly, uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining, and that might have solved the problem of scratchy, itchy fabric.

the stiff fabric of the bo",Negative
163,The online picture does not do this skirt justice. its very pretty and unique in design. i think it should be worn with a tighter shirt that is tucked in unlike the picture. this is truly a pretty pencil skirt.,Positive
167,This will be perfect for the mild fall weather in texas. its light weight and i love that the top is a little more fitted and the bottom swings out.,Positive
169,"I love the dresses by maeve and this one is no exception. i was pleasantly surprised upon receiving this dress because i wasnt sure about the print size and colors when i saw it online, but the print is beautiful. its a very simple but elegant style and the ruffle on the back adds an extra touch of interest. i like that it has enough coverage at the top (front and back), the underarms do not fall very low, and it is lined. the a-line skirt will flatter most body types. the fabric and overall q",Positive
178,"The colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess. it was overall too large, the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish, the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly. had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining, i would have liked it better. the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out. #returned",Negative
182,I like this sweater so much i just bought it in a second color! the pleats make the sweater conform to my shape just enough to be flattering. i wore it over three different dresses this week that might have felt too bare for work or cooler weather. i live in a hot climate so this is the right weight for our cooler months. the metallic threads give it a little bit of flair and the grey color goes with everything. im 57 size 10-12 and the large fit just right.,Positive
184,"Online, this looks like a great sweater. i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured. in fact, im pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer. unfortunately, this sweater will not work for me, as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look 20 pounds heavier.",Negative
185,"I was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture, but i had wishful thinking. i should have gone with my gut! this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases. it is see-through and flimsy. the bottom is just like the picture, it hangs in an odd rumpled way. the top is very flattering though, so its a shame! if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu",Negative
187,This easel caftan is simply amazing! the silhouette fits all sizes and shapes while providing a unique dress.,Positive
191,"I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately its going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but its not. and because its so light, the swing effect doesnt really come off. nothing special.",Negative
197,"Unlike the other reviewers, i did not have any problem with the sizing, fit or length of this skirt. it is a midi skirt so i think its suppose to be a little bit longer?? for me it fit true to size. for reference i am 58, 135 pounds and the size 6 fit perfectly. i think the color is beautiful and the quality is good.",Positive
199,"This skirt looks exactly as pictured and fits great. i purchased it a few weeks ago and got lots of compliments on it. however, on the third wear, the side zipper split wide open. needless to say, it was returned.",Negative
200,"Dang, i got a small and was still swimming in it. its made of the fabric that increasingly seems to be the fabric of choice for all things t-shirty- soft and thin-ish, a bit translucent. id rather wait for something more formfitting and flattering- back it went.",Negative
202,"Bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost. fabric feels cheap, like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly. did not flatter the female form- felt like a burlap sack. gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag. returned it.",Negative
204,"I loved this top; it reminded me of one i have from retailer from circa 2008 in black and white; however, on this one, the chest area is too big, in both the 14 and 16, and i even found myself tugging downward on the fabric to keep it in place because the waist is elastic and also too big. i probably need a size 12, but then i fear it would be too short-waisted on me, for i am 510. unfortunately, it is not for me. also, the sleeves are much bigger and flouncier than they appear in the photo on t",Negative
205,"I love the rich deep color and the style but once again this brand runs really small in the waist. i am normally a 8/10 in retailer skirts and the size 10 was tight at the waist enough so i could not button it and feel comfortable. the quality is ok, something i feel i would see at another type of discount store. for me this skirt did not work but the color and softness of the fabric was a plus.",Negative
209,Love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected. it is soft to the skin and flattering. however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders.,Negative
210,"I have already worn this several times. it is very flattering, lightweight, and easy to wear. dressy but also very soft and comfortable.",Positive
214,"The skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it, and was mostly white, yellow and some red. the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me. the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return.",Negative
216,"Bought a large, could barely pull up over my butt. runs extremely small. its cute but if your not a stick figure, this is not the suit for you.",Negative
217,"Adorable... too chilly now to wear alone & too cute to cover it up! my navy parka or jean jacket will prob be ok w/ it though. size 6 fits me perfectly & looks pretty much on me as in the pic. love plaid & cotton blend tops anyways. ruffles - adorable, & im not too big on that but do love this look. when i first removed this top from the packaging it had an odd smoky-like odor, but its the dye i think. after hanging it for a few days the smell disappeared. i have in mind to wear w/ the pilcr",Positive

232,"The shirt is absolutely cute looking. but thats just that....looks. im 52 size 6 & wears m to l top. i tried on the medium in the store, it was rather flowing. i liked it. but i didnt like how it fit on the underarm area. it hung very low. so i ordered a petite m. still the same. plus the store the lighting was dark so i didnt realize how see through the shirt was too. had to return it.",Negative
233,"These jeans! i tried these on, in addition to the high rise paige denim, and these won out hands down. classic flattering fit from mother, with an element of edginess with the frayed hem. these are long enough on me (im 55) to cuff at the ankle if i dont want a distressed look on a particular day. they are slightly stretchy like other mother denim but not so much that i would size down. i have muscular calves and thighs, but someone who does not could likely size down and be happy with the a",Positive

237,I have a similar pair of capris from retailer and when i ordered these i thought they were the same in a different color. these are less flattering and i may not keep them.,Negative
238,"Fun detail with the beading and lace! arms are a little longer while the body of the sweatshirt is a little shorter than expected, but thats the style of the piece. the fit was tts with those proportions mind.  the ladies at the store said that if i ordered the size up, it might be a little longer in the body, but that the arms and shoulders would have been the biggest change. the material isnt too thick, so its a nice lighter layer for fall/spring. really love it!",Positive
239,"I love the style of this top, and the longer length would be great with leggings and fitted shorts. its somewhat fitted on the top yet its a-line shape gives a full swing at the bottom. the ruffled v-neckline is pretty, and i like the longer length of the short sleeves. but with all these attributes, unfortunately they cut the armholes really big, so when you put your arms forward, the sleeves pull against your arms. i was trying to decide if i should keep it anyway, but for $98 dollars i thin",Negative

288,"I wanted to love this sweatshirt, but alas, it is going back. upon opening and unfolding, the first thing i noticed: the dots and not solid. they are sort of distressed looking, with parts of them missing. secondly, it doesnt have a lot of structure. its soft and kind of floppy but in a weird way. its just not flattering on me. it looks more like a pajama top than something i would wear out of the house. for reference, i ordered the 3, and im usually a 10/12 in tops.",Negative
290,The cut is brilliant-the wash is subtle-the weight of the denim is sturdy but not stuff-and the stretch is just right. love it. the perfect staple. a scarf in the fall and rolled sleeves in the spring.,Positive
292,I love these. im between a 29 and 30 and as the 30s were sold out i had to go with the 29s. they fit well. as expected. very nice fabric. good design. have to wear a short shirt or one tucked in. fabric has a bit of stretch which is also nice.,Positive
296,I love these culottes and i think they will be everywhere this coming spring / summer. the high waist is perfect and looks great with shorter shirts or tucked-in. the denim is high quality and a nice medium dark color.,Positive
297,Im glad i listened to the other reviewers...i ordered a large instead of my usual medium. its roomy enough for a sweater underneath. i love the denim! its very soft and has some stretch. my other denim jackets are stiff even after years of washing. i also love the darker denim.,Positive

315,"Love this top! made with 100% cotton, a vintage look, and flattering details this top is a winner for me. i think it fits true to size (got my regular size 0) and i did not need the petite and i am fairly short (53). it is somewhat see through, but with wearing a nude bra and not wearing it to work, i think it can be worn without a cami. the perfect lightweight, comfortable, standout piece for the summer time :)",Positive
316,I really like this blouse a lot. very very easy to wear!! i wore with pencil skirt to work and with skort as shown similar on model with sandals on weekend. very flattering and great blue color!!! very happy with this purchase. highly recommend. i am 56 short torso and my usual 6 worked.,Positive

325,"Like another reviewer mentioned, this shirt is way too short. im only 52 (xs) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model. also, the quality isnt great as its very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front. its a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique. sadly, its going back!",Negative

338,"When i received this blouse, ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky. some of the fabric would stick to these dots. i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid. however, after hanging on my closet door, the dots are still sticky. i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me.",Positive
343,"I tried this in the store and i like it - nice and soft, good basic design that will pair with many pieces. but i decided to wait because of the price. im sure i would get a lot of use out of this top, but ultimately it didnt thrill me enough to make it my top priority purchase. i bought a sweater that was on sale instead. still, a very nice top. i may buy it eventually, especially if it goes on sale.",Positive

358,This top is good quality and cute. it runs large- im usually a medium and needed a small. the reason i will be returning it is because it flares out at the bottom on the black which is very unflattering on. it makes me look wide in the waist or like im wearing a maternity top. unfortunate because i really liked everything else about it.,Negative
362,"This blouse is super cute but oddly sized. i bought a size up and still i squeezed into the top around the bust. the front slit is too low and shows a bit too much cleavage, so this had to go back. i really tried because the fabric is wonderful and the shirt is light and breezy for summer, i just couldnt make it work

367,"Not sure why this shirt is getting bad reviews. i am tall and have a long torso, so perhaps that is the issue for some who find it not so flattering? maybe if your taller it hangs better? i have to say... i love everything about it. it is a fantastic print, it is very flowy but i dont think its too much in that regard. i think it is fitting with the romantic, girly style of the garment. in my opinion not too short, just right. i took a medium, i am 58 and athletic.",Positive

374,"Surprisingly flattering on, especially with pants/jeans. extremely figure flattering because it enhances the figure and hides flaws: the pleating enhances the bust, the v-cut provides a touch of a peekaboo (not enough to show cleavage but its there in a super flattering way), the hem flares out a bit to hide the tummy and enhance the bust even more; the short sleeves are versatile so it can be worn in the office, under a jacket, or just plain for going out. the material is not too thick but not",Positive

379,This elegant white lace dress attracted compliments everywhere i wore it. it is classic with just the right amount of quirkiness . i like everything about it!,Positive
381,Disappointed in the quality of the dress. love the style and especially the colors. the fabric of the body of the dress is very very thin and just poorly made. the top bodice is more substantial. not worth the price tag of $148.00. dress does run short.,Negative
386,"This skirt is very short. i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle. thats quite off because im only 5 feet tall, and i wore it pretty low on the hips. it also flares out awkwardly below the knee. there are 2 vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem. i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my 5 year old cut up a skirt. plus, the fabric--while thick and beautiful and stretchy--has a",Negative

391,"I saw this online but it never struck me as something i would wear. however, after seeing it in the store it really caught my eye with its detailing, so i tried it on. what a great decision because it is so much more beautiful in person, and very soft and warm. its a perfect winter sweater to start the new year. i am 5-7, 138 lbs. and the medium fit perfectly, though its a little shorter on me than shown in the photos.",Positive
395,"Im surprised other reviewers loved this one so much. its completely different then how it looks on the model. its much shorter, which others do mention, but it flares a lot. enough to feel maternity-ish on me. it looks fitted on the model. maybe its my shape, i have a short torso and carry weight in my hips. i ordered an xs too. i will say the material
is very nice and its well made, but its going back.",Negative
396,"This sweater is fine for the casual days. i bought this in cream and i have to say after one wash it looks old. im a huge retailer lover and buy a lot of clothes from them. this is just not the best quality and looks tired after a few wears. very soft, but poor material. not my favorite purchase.",Negative

515,A beautiful combination of eyelet with a soft fabric which lays beautifully. this does not make you look bigger then you are and i kept tts so the eyelet did not pull. mine fits perfectly. i personally will wear a cami under it as it is a bit sheer for me. it has an almost peacock print to it in colors of brown and tan. the black buttons down the back adds interest and charm. just adore it!,Positive

609,"I just tried on this dress in the store, in red, and i loved the off the shoulder design. the color is just as pictured online (a light poppy red). the neckline began a few inches below my collarbone and was super flattering. however, the skirt portion of this dress flared awkwardly at the hips, causing my hips to look much wider than they really are (and also disturbing the otherwise clean lines of the dress). it seemed to me that there was too much fabric at the back portion of the skirt than",Negative

as noted by other reviewers, there is limited support in the chest; this suit will keep you covered but does not provide lift.",Positive

problem two: the crotch split! in the front! im a teacher. i sincerely hope no one noticed! i read other reviews about this problem and dont know if i got a bad batch or if a similar fate is awaiting other",Negative

653,"Like others, i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting.  for starters, these pants run small, so i ordered a size up but still in petite, because i adored the red ones i got this past summer.  when the black pants arrived, they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones (which were also 6p), and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality.  im debating ordering the regular length, but im not sure ill bother, based on some of the other reviews.",Negative

669,"I tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger. but its basically cut for model-sized people only. its short and wide, and if you have any boobs at all itll make the back pucker. i cant imagine this will look good on most women.",Negative

887,"These run small (i am 110 and got a size 4), they were a tad tight on top. the waist fit but felt a little too snug, short from waist to crotch and then bloomed out in a nice but stiff ish material. they are a dark blue animal print. i felt like bozo the clown goes to the jungle. they looked so silly i had to laugh. even with the 20% off, these are going back. not even comfortable to lounge around the house in never mind being seen by anyone in person!",Negative
889,"I loved the photo of this dress. upon examination of the dress (and trying it on) after receiving in the mail, the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern. the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top. the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo. turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear.",Negative
899,"I ordered these in my usual pilcro petite size 6. they were impossible to button, which is interesting cause i also ordered the pilcro wide leg chinos in the same size and they fit perfectly, as usual. but it ended up being ok because i dont care for the speckled, slightly rough material or the contrasting piping. back they go!",Negative
901,"I was excited to see these jeans since they came in petite sizes and had a short inseam... unfortunately after ordering/returning several pairs, i found out that these are actually not petite jeans. please beware that if you are ordering these for the shorter inseam, they are actually 28 in... not 24 in as in the description. other than the inseam issues, they fit like typical paige denim.",Negative
902,"This top is super cute, however the bottom hem is all frayed....couldnt really tell that from the pictures. the flutter sleeves are too big...looks funny with the fraying...runs a little large as well. loved the color! perfect with white denim!",Negative

915,"I received this skirt today and was very disappointed. i dont know what i expected but it is not as i thought. even though the quality is very good and the fit is true to size, i may return it. the fabric of the skirt is just too busy, at least for me. i am just uncertain and even though i have many tops, the colors are just not matching. white looks better than any colored top with this particular print. i am going to try it on one more time and make a definite decision.",Negative
916,"This top will be perfect for autumn and even winter down in the southeast. i purchased the red and hoped that it was more of a rust color-lucked in! the material is very soft and more on the thinner side for layering-which is alway a plus. i have spare tires in my belly area and this does not grab aholed of them,in fact the stripes do the work and disguise! and the lace up nautical feel brings the attention to my money maker! you wont be disappointed",Positive
917,"I ordered this on a whim during retailer days sale and im glad i did. its now one of those shirts that calls my name every morning. ive worn it with denim skinnies and a knee length black knit pencil skirt. so soft and flattering. i got it in the red, but am tempted by the blue!",Positive
921,"Dont pay attention to the less-than-flattering photo. these jeans are super cute and very flattering. they are actually long, not ankle length as the photo implies. high waisted with a 70s bell bottom vibe. nice light denim for year round wear. they fit like a dream.",Positive
924,"Love these jeans! they are the perfect relaxed fit; not too baggy, and a straight style. i did size down, because i wanted to wear them as shown. i was afraid that they would ride too low on my hips. glad i did! i usually wear size 29/6 and took a 28 in this pair. the color and denim weight is also great.",Positive

927,"I saw this skirt online and went to the store immediately to try on. i was a bit disappointed. the size is tts but the prints were prettier online. the material is ok. the regular is long so probably wont look good on a shorter person
if it is still available when the price comes down, i might buy it.",Negative
928,"The colors are richer than shown- very vibrant. this piece is very unique and everthing that i love about retailer! i usually wear a medium in jackets and vest. i tried the small and there was very little difference from the small or the medium fit, so i went a size up, just for a looser look. it is very flattering and will be a great addition to my fall wardrobe!",Positive
933,"Sits at waist, length is perfect for petite, quality is very good, looks very nice on me, very recommend",Positive
934,I found these to fit odd. i am also use to wearing the skinny jeans so trying a wide leg was a bit weird anyway. the placement of the pockets and the way it hit my waist was awkward and not flattering. i am usually a 8/10 and the 8 fit but just did not look good.,Negative

937,"I loved this dress and it fit great on me: 57, 115 lbs, wore an xs. it was a little tighter than i wish, but the s would have been too loose. unfortunately, when i received the dress the arms were already pilling. it is made of a mix of polyester, and while its machine washable (yay), i can imagine this dress would be pilling very easily, and i wish the fabric was a higher quality for the price, so i returned it.",Negative
939,Purchased these jeans in a 27 and i am usually a 28 in skinny jeans. i got the 26s on but they were snug. these jeans are so comfy and sit higher on the waist. great jeans!,Positive
940,"I purchased the coral version, and the color is wonderful and vibrant. it fit my daughter beautifully, and she is 510. i think she will be wearing this coat often, she loves it!!! she is 23 years old and has a professional job, so she will look the part.",Positive
942,The dress arrived with a few snags and the fabric already pilling. the fabric will only get worse with wear. return. cute concept; poor fabric quality.,Negative
943,I love the design and pattern of this top. it runs big so an xs was roomy on me but still cute. the neck is wide. i returned it bc the material of the top isnt for me. the texture is too soft.,Negative
944,"Very comfortable dress, with a gorgeous pattern. it comes with a self liner in navy that is very smoothing - i was worried a figure hugging sweater knit would be unflattering. cut is perfect. im a size 10/12 on top and 12/14 on bottom, and the m was the best fit. the neckline is a deep scoop so if you are not busty it may come down too far for comfort.",Positive
945,"I was so excited when this dress went on sale.  it is very soft and the print is so distinctive.  it is super comfy but not slimming or flattering at all.  i am a curvy girl,  wear a medium 8/10 and this made me look so wide!  the skirt is quit full,  a small would have fit but the top was tight.  so disappointing.",Negative
948,"After reading the reviews i placed an order because it was the only top that caught my eye on the entire price downs. lately all my usual l/10 sizes from retailer turn out huge so i ordered a size smaller from what i usually wear. all would have been ok if the top wasnt so darn short. for reference im 6 ft tall, 160 lb. its weird that this top looks completely the opposite of the model on the photo, from a loose looking fit with longer sleeves looking like a stylized sweatshirt that is not what",Negative
951,"These are both adorable and practical?theyre versatile enough to dress up or down, and they are just warm enough for fall temperatures. these will definitely be my go-to tights this season.",Positive
954,This is an absolutely gorgeous dress that stands out everywhere i go. it runs true to size and has a slimming effect because of the detail running down the sides.,Positive
955,"51 43-31-43. i really wanted to love this coat: the material is nice, the green color is dark and rich, it has a hood. however, the cut is bad for me (and probably a lot of other people). the shoulders were cut too wide and impeded movement, and the bust and hips were cut too tight, overall it was just boxy. i have another boiled wool coat that i bought at retailer about 7 years ago and though its cut oversize like this one, it has a much fuller sweep, so the proportions still seem right. also",Negative
956,"First, ive been in love with this dress for months. when it went on sale i absolutely had to have it! im 54 and 150 pounds and typically wear large stuff from retailer but after reading other reviews i decided to get the medium. its more generous than i expected and wonder if i couldve even gone with a small. i might try a belt. either way im very very happy with the dress. the sleeves are not too long - and i didnt get the petite because i wanted the length in the skirt. the lining makes",Positive
957,"The sweater coat is a must try on! its a great fall to winter coat, that you can leave on all day if you need. i bought the dark green, which is very dark yet gorgeous and have the beautiful coral saved in my cart as well. i am 55, 135lbs, 34c, ordered the size small and have plenty of room (did not want it tight and wanted to be able to wear over thick layers).",Positive
958,"Just purchased this coral coat today. the color is beautiful. the quality is excellent and the coat itself is lightweight,great for travel. great purchase and would recommend buying. going to new york and cant wait to wear it . love, love this coat",Positive
963,"I originally got these in a 29 petite and thought they fit great right out of the bag (im usually a 6/8).. and within an hour of wearing them (to retailer, actually), the knees had gotten so baggy that they looked absolutely ridiculous; ive never had jeans do this. the salesperson at retailer agreed that they seemed very odd. i exchanged for a 28p at her suggestion, and i just hate them. id say the smaller size seems every so slightly small, but nothing major - but the waist actually folds over a",Negative
965,"This skirt is not what i was expecting at all. for starters it runs large, i expected it to sit at the natural waist and it is definitely made to do so, but it was a good two inches too big and therefore wouldnt lay flat and gaped at the front. no bueno. my biggest gripe, though, is that the color looks nothing like it does in the picture. they have it paired with an ivory top and the two look like they match so well but do not be fooled, the background color of this skirt is not even close to",Negative
967,"I wanted to love these pants, but they were larger than i expected and the fabric is very heavy. almost like a thick sweater.",Negative
968,"It pills a little under the arms and picks up lint, but its totally worth it. this is a fabulous sweater coat. i receive compliments on it wherever i go. so cozy, warm & delicious. not too hot to wear indoors either. its breathable. love it. bought in green during black friday sale. highly recommend.",Positive
969,"Omg - wish it came in more colors,,",Positive
970,"This dress has a beautiful fit; eyed it for awhile--snatched it up at the dress sale! only drawback was the edging around the neck; on some, the cream-patterned fabric was used and it was distracting. hunted around at stores, but ended up getting lucky with online purchase.",Positive
972,Very cheap looking material. looks cheap to cost $158.,Negative
975,"What a well-designed dress! the cut is a slight a-line without adding bulk and the pattern is very slimming. the lining makes this a pretty good option for cooler weather. the neck is pretty wide, as others have noted, but i find that a heavy cream colored scarf is a pretty good accent. it does run a little large. im 55/130lbs and went with the xsp.",Positive
978,"I tried this dress on in the store and ended up ordering it online during the dress sale. it is extremely flattering and really accentuates the waist. it is very comfortable, and made of a nice, soft fabric. i am a 34a and it just barely reveals a tiny bit of cleavage so i dont find the neckline too low. i plan to wear it with tights and booties. i am 5 4 and the regular xs comes to a bit below my knees. going to enjoy wearing this lovely dress!",Positive
980,"The colors in this dress are much less vibrant in person. the scoop of the neckline is very wide and deep. i know others have posted that this is a great dress for work, but not in my workplace.",Negative
986,So different than anything in my closet. its wide with a beautiful drape. fabric is soft but substantial. it has the cutest coral color lining the placket and inside of the lower sleeves. i sized down to a medium and could have gone to a small but i love the length and drape which might not translate in fit in the smaller size. so cute on.,Positive
988,"This jacket is worth every penny! it is light enough to wear when like 55/60 out or good when it is in the 40s with a sweater underneath. the fit and design of the coat is amazing! i love the full collar look - thats my favorite detail of the jacket. loved the green so much, i bought the coral too! i normally wear a 12/14 in clothes and the large was perfect!",Positive
991,"Best jeans ever! its so hard to find a good petite jean. you shop and shiop and then pay $30 more to get them altered. the fit and length on these are perfect. love, love, love!!!",Positive
992,"I really like the sundry brand. however. this is thin and to me out of character for an retailer tee. it look adorable in picture. however the coloring is way off. the navy is almost black its so dark and the kaki stripe is a green. its nothing like i had hoped it would be. fabric in very thin and more like a pajama top. so disappointed. it will go back. i do not make it a habit to bash a product. however with tax, shipping and 83.00 price tag. 103.11 is absolutely terrible.",Negative
993,"This is a comfortable sweater dress, and the quality of the material seems good. the solid blue strip down the front makes it look very bland. i think it would need some dressing up with a necklace or scarf. i decided to pass.",Negative
994,"I ordered this in the orange color from online. they were sold out of petite so i ordered medium (regular). i liked it, but just not flattering. i am 52 and the coat was too big. sleeves were past my hands. i think because im curvy the straight cut of coat would not have looked good on me in a size small. it was a nice coat, just not for me.",Negative
1000,Warn and super soft. love it !,Positive
1003,Im 51 and about 110lbs. ordered the small because i do have some curves- it was huge- more like a large and didnt have much structure at all. the wool was very soft and stretchy. and like others have said- kinda orange- not true coral color. it fit me like a throw blanket- its going back for sure. might purchase again if the petite xs is back in stock and on sale- this should def be under $100.,Negative
1012,"This dress hung so nicely on my figure (small up top, bigger in the hips) that i couldnt pass it up. the lines are more flattering in person than in the photos. it might run a little small...im normally an extra small, but it was a little snug in the arms. however, the small was too big, so i would suggest sticking with your usual size. the saleslady said would stretch a little. i would have loved to try a petite, but the store didnt carry petite sizes. it will be my go-to holiday dress.",Positive

1018,Snapped this sweet puppy up at my local retailer-in the sale room!!!!! it is beyond fabulous and the coral color is divine!!!! brightens up the drearriest of days-i did size down. i am short and the small sleeves were way too long on my 5ft3in frame. it runs a bit large but if you were to wear a heavier something under it i could see getting your normal size. the quality is great and the style is just lovely. great jacket-love love love,Positive

1023,"At first, i thought this sweater might be too boxy, but fastened at the waist, its very flattering and the collar is face-framing, and the coral in particular (really more of a mango sorbet shade) is unexpected but cheery for winter.

but the big selling point is the warmth and the giant pockets. brought a new puppy home just after christmas, and this sweater is perfect for layering for late- night trips out with an easy place to stash my phone and treats. bought it in coral and pink.",Positive
1025,I love this dress. will be wearing it for the first time tomorrow. it fits well. the neck line is a bit low on me. i think it would look best on someone with more of a chest than i have. i will be wearing a winter white infinity scarf with it (as shown on model). i am 5 6.5 and 120 lbs and the small is just right.,Positive
1026,"Love this sweater jacket! super comfortable and warm. i am 52 and i got a xs petite. it fit perfectly both in length and in the sleeve. the green color is super rich and is perfect for the season. its easy to wear it up and wear it down. i appreciate that its not super bulky, which was what i was afraid of. my favorite jacket of the season so far.",Positive

1039,"Absolutely love this suit. the bottoms are very comfortable and covers everything id like it to. it does not ride up at all, which almost never happens with swim suits. im going to order this in a different color next season. i paired the bottoms with the peplum top and received many compliments.",Positive
1040,I just love this dress.  took me ordering a number of sizes- petite and regular to find the best fit.  i might still have the top altered.  i received a lot of compliements.  work it with some black leather wedges for daytime/work.,Positive
1041,I got the purple color and absolutely love it. i am 52 but decided against the petite size and i wanted it to be a bit longer. i also went with the xxs as the xs was a bit too loose on the arm. it was definitely a splurge to buy the sweater but it looked so lovely!,Positive
1047,"I ordered this in a small petite and medium petite , and i am a huge fan of a*k. i put tried on the sp. while it fit, it was very long, even for a petite. what i hated about it was that the piping on the top made me look very wide. even a long necklace wouldnt help deter the look. on a positive side, the blue was a very nice, cool color. i am usually a small to medium in a*k (6-8 in tops) and the small fit well in the arms/bodice, just too much fabric for me. returning!",Negative
1052,"My perspective is as a sewer so im more picky perhaps. this top is poorly made. the fabric pattern is crooked or not consistent in each piece. sewers do this to save $ - squeezing the pieces on the fabric. it looks sloppy. the cut is very full; the bottom edge measures 104 around. for my figure, curvey, at 56 and 150lbs, this top is not flattering it looks maternity. perhaps best on a slim figure and with leggings.",Negative
1057,"This top reminded me of a maternity top. cute, but better suited for someone smaller chested.",Negative
1058,I love this shirt so much i am ordering the coral too! the weight of the material makes it hang nicely. there is a lot of material but it lends itself to the flowy style. i got many compliments of this top!,Positive
1059,"This sweater is perfect! finally a sweater that doesnt make me look like a huge box!

i bought the blue & it has other colors running through it so ill be able to wear it with chinos & jeans. very pretty, flattering & i think im going to be wearing this a lot.",Positive

the silk is soft and the slip underneath is perfect. the tie in the back perfectly cinches the dress and the pleating is a wonderful detail to the look.

1078,"I agree with the other reviewers that this runs big. unfortunately there is nothing smaller than an xs so this is going back. i love the lyocell material, i have another skirt with this material and wanted to love this as well but it is too big and with the drawstring pulled tight to fit it doesnt look right. it is not as pictured as well. the skirt i received is a medium blue denim, not the lovely light blue as pictured, another reason why i am returning.",Negative
1081,"I always end up walking out of an retailer store with something very different than what i thought and this was one. it drapes beautifully and the red color is rich and vibrant, cool tone not orangey. i fell in love with this one in person. it jumped at me in the store, but online i think the outfit that the model is wearing is not my style at all and does not do the item justice. if you like to cover your assets, you will love it.",Positive
1089,"I was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail. the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck. that being said, i was so disappointed in the fit. i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped. cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides. made no sense! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit. order up for length, down for arm length ...",Negative
1091,"I order this shirt because it looked like a shirt you could dress up or down. when i got it the shirt was really wrinkled. therefore, i knew it would have to ironed a lot. it was quite boxy and was shorter in the front then in the back. i didnt realize that this shirt was two different fabrics. overall i think this shirt would be more flattering on a woman that was petite.",Negative
1097,Comfortable and great fit and color. high quality.,Positive
1098,I loved this blouse when i got it and wore it before washing. it fit really well and was flattering. the only time i laundered it i hand- washed it in cold water and hung it to dry. the blouse shrunk at least a full size and in awkward places. the sleeves are now tight and way too short. the overall length shortened by at least 2 inches. the top is so tight in the bust now that the buttons popped open. im very disappointed and surprised.i will be returning it as it is unwearable as is.,Negative
1099,"This bunches up too much, and the fabric is even more see through than i expected (so even with a tank top under it, its not a good look for work). even unbuttoned at the top, i could barely get this over my head!  this one is going back.",Negative

sadly, its going back.",Negative

obviously they are going back tomorrow . im very disappointed, they are a nice looking jogger and the color is pretty.",Negative
1142,"First of all, the label on this dress is maeve, not nue by shani. second, i just wasnt impressed. the fabric is cool...it has a sort of embossed look to it and its somewhat shiny, which sets it apart in a good way. but the cut is just boring. the top felt dowdy to me...overall, i was underwhelmed by this dress and returned it.",Negative

1156,I fell in love with this dress the instant i saw it. but was disappointed when i received it. first was the color. i chose the green and it wasnt what i thought. it was a very unnatural shade of artificial grass. when my husband saw it in the package he thought i had ordered a cheap grass hula skirt. the color was that bad. the fit was the next problem. this dress would have fit nicely if they had just added a side zip and made the top more fitted. the top was loose and that added to the flowy,Negative

1381,"Although i love the soft feel of the sweater, the zig zag design was very unflattering. also, the length is much shorter than appears in the picture. i will be returning it.",Negative
1389,Im not crazy about maxi dresses so when i found this fun print with fringe-it spoke my language. love this dress. feel this dress will work with many seasons. dress falls nicely and feels comfortable. i was worried it would be too long but with a 2 inch heel-its perfect. have paired it with some red dangled earrings that spice it just right.,Positive
1390,"For the price of this dress, i was expecting something decent. the style is cute, but nothing more. however, the type of the polyester that the dress is made of.... oh my. it is a thick unpleasant material, that will cling to a body when it is hot. i never came across an item at retailer that was made this cheaply.
the tag on the back was hanging at half and the button on the front was ready to come off before i even tried this dress on.
no need to say - its going back asap.
you should not sel",Negative
1391,"I have been wanting this sweater and decided to order. when i received it, there was no tag on the product. it was not in a typical clear bag from retailer and it wasnt packaged nicely. it came from reno, nv. most products i order do not get shipped from there. it is short, and im 51. most clothes that are short fit me with no problem. this sweater might hit me at the waist, or maybe shorter. i think the color is nice and the sweater is soft but not what i wanted. i am going to return it",Negative
1393,I purchased this dress for my bridal shower and it was perfect! the details on it are amazing-delicate and lovely! i am 511 and it hit just above my ankles which i loved because i could show off my shoes!,Positive

1401,"I bought this top at my local retailer in a burgundy color. it is so beautiful and feminine. i want to get it in the other color they had in the store and also this black one available on-line. i bought it in a size 6 and i am 5 2 , 34d. i sometimes get tops in petite but i felt the reg size fit just fine.",Positive
1409,"This top runs small across the top. i was amazed at the material--polyester, i am sure--because the price was so high. it has a sheer layer underneath, which i think would make it hot in the summer. i love this kind of tank but it just did not look as good as it does online.",Negative
1411,"I bought this tank in the blue popsicle print, and i think its cuter in person than it is online. the beautiful pastel colors on the popsicles really stand out and make it special. i am normally a size 4-6, and the small fits me perfectly. also, i appreciate that its lined. i wore it with skinnies, and received lots of compliments. its the perfect tank for summer!",Positive
1415,This well made chemise is figure flattering and just the right length for me (52). i would wear it as a slip or a nightie. looking forward to wearing it!,Positive
1418,"I ordered this in the plum color, which in real life just looks like a very, very dark brown. that would probably be okay, but the dress is actually about 3 inches shorter than the listed measurements. i ordered the regular length, but the shortest part of the hem hits me only about halfway down my thigh...way, way too short. i am 55, for reference. lastly, i think the fabric is just awful quality, especially for this price point. the slight texture makes it want to cling to itself - worn ou",Negative

1422,This dress is super comfortable and the material is so soft. the fit is very flattering and will cover any imperfections if you are heavier and want to hide anything. its more fitted in the top and drapes on the body very nicely. the hem is asymmetrical and the highest part of the hem hits about 2 inches above my knee and i am 53. i will wear this with tights for work. color is very nice also.,Positive
1428,I ordered a regular size xs and the length is still fine for me at 52. i love the color and the fabric is super soft and comfortable. ill get a lot of use out of it this summer and the sale price is a great bargain!,Positive
1433,"Im a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses, especially the petite xs maxis. this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made. 

it was humongous and gave me no shape. even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same. im small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess-- which also makes no sense because its the petite size. 

do not buy. im very upset i have to pay the $5.95 return fee since i ordered this.",Negative
1434,"The dress is just ok. i cannot imagine having paid full price for this. i got it for florida vacation. i put it on to wear to church first and spilled a drop of lavender oil on it and it stained!!!! cant get it out. thats punk for a dress that even on sale is like.

1440,"Looks fitted on, but this just turned out to be an oversized muumuu on. the fabric also felt cheap.",Negative
1441,This is a solid well made transistional dress going from late summer to fall. im 57 and got the medium and it falls a little above my knee. i could see it being very flattering on many body types. i do think you need to accessorize the dress as it is on the bland side. i bought the plum/brown color and am very happy with it.,Positive
1445,So i got this on sale and the only size they had was a xs petite. i didnt have my hopes very high but i thought i would give it a shot. the dress came today and it fit great. i am 56 so the petite came just above my knees but the dress is still adorable. the material and cut is great. this is not what i was looking for but it is a welcome addition.,Positive
1447,"I have mixed feelings about this dress. the color is fantastic. not too bright, not too dark. the material is super soft and comfortable and the length was perfect. i did end up returning this item though as no matter which bra i chose, the straps showed. it just was not hitting my right on the shoulders. i do not like having my bra straps show or constantly be trying to tuck them away (especially at a wedding or work?). this is what ultimately led me to return the dress ? even though it is beau",Negative
1448,"This dress is super soft and really flattering. im 52 and i tried a regular size m in the store and hated it on me, but decided to order a petite m and give it a try and i love it. its one ive been wearing a lot with ankle boots and all sorts of jackets. its great for these fall days that are still warm-ish. would be really cute with tights.",Positive
1452,Despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it. im typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small. the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit id said for more for a b. (if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it),Negative
1453,Love the sweater. the knit has a rich look and the fit is perfect. i paired it with a printed pencil skirt for an eclectic look. strongly recommend to your wardrobe.,Positive
1455,"This is a nice shirt, but i cant keep it. i ordered a 0 and i do have an athletic build with somewhat wider shoulders given how petite i am (usually wear 00 petite in all pants) and i think this size was perfect (fit across the back perfectly) when you lift your arms the way it is cut makes it really tight across the chest and shows your stomach. at the same time, the high low styling makes for a really strange shirt-tail in the back. im sure this is the trend but it really does not look cute",Negative
1458,"I just got this in the mail & had to immediately write a review. i love it!. i took a risk & ordered the xxs, which i assume is a 00. it fits me perfectly so i would say it runs large. im a true dress size 2 but usually wear a 0 or xs in us sizing. the shoulder length from seam to seam is about 14 inches. im 32c-24-34. hope this helps!",Positive
1459,"This shirt feels so nice, its heavier weight and so soft.. i think its lyocel... such a great drape to the shirt that is so flattering. i am 58 128lbs and 34c/d and purchased a size 4. found this item to be true to size, if not slightly loose, but i love the flow of it. highly recommend, the green is classic and timeless, very versatile.",Positive

1464,You have to be a contortionist to get this bra on. it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows. ridiculously impractical. why oh why didnt heather give it a hook and loop closure instead?,Negative
1465,"I love this top, i dress it up when i need to be more professional and i dress it down with a pair of cutoffs when its warm. it is delicate, however, so i try not to wash it too frequently. the front is a bit boxy, which the model demonstrates. the model really encompasses the crisp whiteness of the shirt, the flow of it and the length.",Positive
1467,"This was going to be my go to top. i loved the look of the billowy shirt, especially in light blue. when it arrived, i knew it wouldnt work for my body. im athletic build with muscular upper arms and a d cup. i tried it on anyway. i really wish it fit. it was snug in the upper arms and pulled a bit in the front. i knew if i ordered a size up the arms would still be tight. its just the cut of the shirt. this top is best for someone that isnt busty and has slender upper arms.",Negative
1470,"I was looking for an oversized silhouette but this is more like a beach cover-up. the waist does not have elastic or any structure. the top fabric is crossed over but not sewn closed, and because the fit is so loose it just gaps open. the fabric is nice quality but i am returning.",Negative
1474,Saw this on the sale rack and decided to try on. i looked like the dancing hypos in the movie fantasia. i am petite and not heavy but this is for very slim and tall people. too much fabric in the peplum part.,Negative
1475,This product is comfortable and stylish. i love the design and the color print. i can dresss it up and dress it down. it goes with everything and also fits great.,Positive
1478,Love this top for the fall. looks great with dark skinny jean and booties.,Positive
1481,Runs a size big unless you want it really boxy. felt the matl was flimsy and would prob pill soon. turquoise was a pretty color but returning this one.,Negative
1482,"I ordered these because i loved the wide cut and overall look. but returned them because they fit weird. too tight around the too high waistline (and normally, i like a high waistline). fit ran small. and the overall quality of the fabric wasnt as nice as i was hoping for. pretty disappointed.",Negative
1483,"I wanted this tank to work so badly! it was a great deal and so beautiful. unfortunately the top fitted portion ends right below my chest then the shirt flares out so i looked like a cupcake. my belly also showed slightly because the shirt is short. if you have a short torso, this would work great. if not, unfortunately, its not great - tear",Negative
1484,"I am 58 with curvy, muscular body and 36ddd boobs. the ruffle ends up hitting me right below my breasts and creates the look of being about 6 months pregnant. the beading is beautiful and i wish that it fit.",Negative

1496,"I wanted to like this top so so so so badly. so badly in fact, that after the first size didnt fit, i ordered two other sizes to make sure: xl, l, m. none of them worked i really wanted to like this top. the online photo makes the clothing look so flattering and the shirt is just not....at least on me. the shirt online on the model looks slimming and a lot longer than the actual piece of the clothing. the beaded work is very beautiful, but short causing the very poofy peplum to start at the mos",Negative
1498,"I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down. however, the jacket was still too large. it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge. also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy. it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes.",Negative
1499,"I stumbled upon this by accident and i thought the turquoise color looks unique so i tried it on, and it was a great fit first time around. i dislike open shoulder blouses because most of them are too open but this one is very sutble which gives it a girl next door sexy look. the material is very soft, the pattern is subtle plaid, and the liner is a plus. size 2 regular fits me very comfortably (im 52, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i could size down more but i like the relaxed look like on the mod",Positive
1500,"Gorgeous colors on lovely silk skirt. longer on me than in photo, but im only 54. i usually wear a size 12 or 32 waist jeans, but i could not zip up the large. by several inches. im not sure if i can possibly cover the waist and still wear it that way. sad because ive had my eye on this for months:(",Positive
1501,"Absolutely beautiful - 
usually dont leave reviews here, but this top (material, beading, style) is so gorgeous i would be remiss if i didnt. i have a short torso, so the peplum hit me above the belly-button. its very voluminous, but with the right pants and heels, it is a perfect outfit. as a full-time student, im apt to find retailer expensive - but this purchase was so very much worth it. in terms of sizing- i initially got the s to accommodate my bust (30f) but preferred the xs.",Positive
1503,"Beautiful dress with the colors and pleats. i did not have the same problems with the bust area that others did. my biggest complaint is the exposed zipper doesn&#39;t lay flat, even when just hanging on the hanger. when actually on a person the zipper juts out. had to be returned!",Negative
1505,"I have to confess i had very high hopes for this dress. i was buying it as a stylish, modern alternative to a business suit. i wanted this dress to work as a piece to deliver presentations in or attend faculty functions. tailored, conservative, and edgy at the same time. several hundred dollars dress should meet the aforementioned needs, i thought. but it did not. the best description for the dress is blah, average.

the material is textures and crinkly, not slick. the top is cream/ivory color",Negative
1508,"I really liked this top when i tried it on but as i wore it the bottom of the sleeves stretched out terrible where they looked worn out from wearing over and over, and since this happened with the first wearing and i paid $88.00 i sent it back. if it hadnt been for that its a comfy and cute casual top",Negative
1510,I know this product description says oversized but thats an understatement. i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their fathers jacket. i dont even think an xs would have worked. im 56 and about 135 pounds for reference. i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but its just way too big.,Negative
1512,"I bought three of these this summer--a mint, ivory, and yellow. when i received them, they looked nice enough in person. i liked the heart motif and the peplum. the problem is the knit was on the cheap side and stretched out. the arms were tighter than i liked but loosened up through the day. but, then the look became more matronly. i wish they had been 3/4 length or a vest. the cheap, outstretched look just didnt work. i ended up donating all of mine after a few wears. they also pilled conside",Negative
1515,This is such a beautiful dress.  but have to return for the reasons others have noted.  the chest does not fit well.,Negative
1516,"Girls, this dress is gorgeous.  but if you are an a/b cup, there is just too much fabric in the bust.  the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down, so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number.  alas, i had to send it back and was very sad to do so.",Positive
1519,"This top can be dressed up or down, very good quality fabric and colors shown as the photo (blue). i usually wear petite sizes but chose the regular version because i wanted to be able to tuck it in. i think it might be too short otherwise.",Positive
1524,Exactly as pictured. great fit. love it.,Positive
1525,"Absolutely love everything about this sweater. i was hesitant to buy because its so oversized and i was worried it would overwhelm my small frame. but the xs fits great, i love the large knit look and the bell sleeves. pairing with dark denim skinny jeans helped balance out the sweaters oversized shape. wore it work and then to a party and received compliments on it all day.",Positive
1527,"The quality of this vest is outstanding, and the warmth is exceptional. i have worn it as a jacket on milder days, in work as a warmth layer and brought on vacation to act as both plus a bathrobe. it is a very stylist piece that can be worn open or belted. it runs large by style, but i am 51, 100 lbs and i can carry it off.",Positive
1528,This vest was of excellent weight but it had very little style. it was like a giant piece of felt was cut out with little thought to design or nuance. not for me.,Negative
1529,"I love this skirt! its a denim material, so its structured, but not too heavy for warm weather. the colors are bright. it may run a bit big, but i didnt have trouble with my usual size. the pockets are actually usable. great for casual and easy to dress up.",Positive
1530,Love the print of this fabric & the length. the buckles at the waist add a unique look so no belt necessary.,Positive
1541,"I felt inspired to write a review as soon as i put this on. the vest fits so well, and the thick fabric feels amazing. love the pockets! like the previous reviewer, i feel like ill be able to wear this with workout clothes or with a dressier outfit. it has an ever so slight racer back, so probably would look weird with sleeveless tops that come all the way to your shoulders, but i can already think about so many ways i want to wear it. the draping in the front also falls really nicely. great bu",Positive
1542,"With my 59, hourglass frame, wider hips and having a baby, i wear normally sizes 10/12 (m/l) in most retailer skirts and dresses. however, with this, i was able to fit into an 8; it just sat higher up and was too form fitting for my liking. here are my thoughts:
_________
pros:
- lots of stretch and comfort.
- pockets! always a plus in my book :)
- will go with any top.
- nice length. fit me as in the model.
- very slimming.
- you could probably go down a size if you are slender with not wide hi",Positive
1543,"This is a favulous cape...in fact i would buy another if there were other colors! it is oversized, playful, chic, dramatic and simply put a true statement piece. it will not be flattering to your figure...it is not suppose to...but it will show your true sense of style! wish it had pockets...i may add them for more play.",Positive
1545,"I ordered a small and it is enormous; i usually wear a size 10. it is short but the fullness in the body and the sleeves made me look like a sumo wrestler. also, it is a very heavy knit which would be great for up north but too bulky for atlanta unless the temps are in the 40s. im sending it back.",Negative
1553,"Lovely knit and so soft, but the bottom curls up underneath, similar to the bell sleeves. runs oversize too, got xs and its too bulky and unflattering since the bottom doesnt lay flat. returned!",Negative

1560,"Ive passed this dress by a number of times online, but ordered it on a whim on the mothers day promo. based on the reviews, i ordered my regular size, medium. it fit perfectly. i do think the cut is on the trim side, but it isnt tight or fitted. i probably couldnt eat a big meal in this though as it would probably show in this dress. the fabric is buttery soft! the button placket down the front is very clean and lays flat. there are two side pleats that are a different fabric and are ever so",Positive
1563,"You make classy stuff. this skirt is a nice take on a tweed skirt.
colors: cant tell from the picture, but there is red and pink thread as part of the tweed, very fun and happy, yet appropriate colors for fall and winter. the cut is very flattering, the scallop part is interesting though, it is sown at one part of the skirt, in the middle, not sure why. i ordered the 0p, and that fit me like a glove.

length on the petite was above the knee, like show",Positive

1569,"Tried on this maxi dress recently, hoping i would have a new dress to enjoy but the frabic is just too thin. so sad :(. unfortunately it shows every lump and bump and even wearing spanx while trying on it still showed too much. a full length slip would help but i decided to put it back.",Negative
1571,These are some of my favorite new pants. i am never disappointed by the quality from this brand and they are super comfortable and adorable. a definite must have!,Positive

1600,I sized up based on other reviews which was good advice. i am typically a size 6 but sized up to a 10. the pants are very unique and i think on the right body type would look amazing. it seems like someone with curves and a small waist might fit these splendidly...but thats not me. i had some extra material puffing about in the zipper region. i also expected the material to be thicker but found it to be more silky.,Negative
1602,"Got these in the red brick color, and unfortunately had to send them back. these are really cute and i loved the color and pattern, but they ran very small, and the cut between the legs and hips was odd. this may not have been a problem had i gone up at least one size. best to try them on if possible.",Negative

extremely soft and flattering. i normally wear a xs/s and the small fit perfectly. im 56 and the length is just slightly cropped.",Positive

1630,I bought this today in a size 2. fits perfect. i am normally a 0 or 2 or xs. the top looks and fits exactly like the picture if you are small chested. because it is not long in the front. i think if you are larger chested the top will stick out too much and be too short in front. it is not super voluminous in front which is a good thing. it does have the volume in the back which gives it a cute shape. it is on the shorter side. very nice material and design as well as details. overall good pick.,Positive
1631,This dress is absolutely beautiful! it fits like a glove and the material is super soft. so in love with this! im 52m and normally a xs/s. the xspwas a better fit in the waist and chest. the arm holes were a bit tighter on me. the sp was way too large.,Positive
1634,"I decided to try this on just for fun because the colors and design are absolutely gorgeous. here are my thoughts:

pros:
- the jeweled neckline is lovely! it really helps set the dress apart.
- pockets!!! such an elegant dress to have pockets is a huge plus in my book. :)
- the length is ideal for taller folk.
- it swings beautifully on the body and flares out quite a bit on the bottom. if youre tall as i am, this wont be an issue.
- nicely conservative at the top.

cons:
- i",Positive
1635,I loved this sweater when i saw it online and ordered right away. i purchased a s and the fit was very off. the arms were long (which i dont mind) but the sweater was also super heavy and bulky so it was not at all flattering. i really wanted to love it and it seemed to be of good quality but it i had to return it.,Negative
1637,Beautiful colors,Positive
1638,"This just wouldnt lay right on me. the top is really too big. maybe if youre really busty, this is great, but not for me. i know the top is supposed to be a bit blousy, but it was huge and droopy and unflattering (not like in the picture). the arm holes were too big and hung down so you could see my bra, which i really hate and which is way too common lately. the bottom half fit perfectly, so sizing up or down would not have helped. the material is super light and comfy, which i liked very muc",Negative
1641,"This dress is stunning! my sister-in-law was hoping to use it as a bridesmaid dress for her wedding and i ordered it for fitting purposes. it fit beautifully on my 510 frame. unfortunately she decided against it due to availability and because of the length on the shorter bridesmaids. while it fell to a couple inches above my ankles, it made the shorter girls look shorter. i ended up returning it but am regretting not keeping it now!",Positive
1642,"I was a little concerned ordering these online without seeing them in person but they do not disappoint! the fabric has a little texture to it that makes them look and feel like a high quality pant. the design is unique and provides visual appeal, and i still feel like i can wear them in my office without looking out of place. i love the high waist on these!",Positive
1644,"This skirt is a nice medium weight and is lined. my normal size 4 fit perfect. i only wish it was available in petites. if you are petite, the skirt is ankle length. but this is a good skirt to wear to work.",Positive
1645,"Runs large and pocket detail is very prominent. wanted a crisper, trouser-like pant--this is not it!",Negative
1646,"The beadwork is gorgeous, but the sleeves are so puffy, it looks as though youre wearing shoulder pads. the fabric of the shirt isnt that fabulous either.",Negative
1649,"Very pretty top, comfortable and soft but looks nice enough for work!",Positive
1650,Normally i am a size 10 or 12 but i sized down to a small. still very swingy and beautiful. i bought the pink and the taupe as well. the colors are beautiful and have great texture to hide stains!,Positive
1654,The blue was a great color and i like the idea of a reversible top. however the xs was just swimming on me. this looks much more fitted in the pictures. my favorite workout top is from this brand and it is fitted and held up for 6 months. where are the fitted tops?? ill keep looking.,Negative
1658,This is not worth $128. it looks cute on but....there is no support in the bust area. just a slight tuck in the fabric -it also is very flowy which is great and it is comfortable but for the price and the thinness and lack of meatiness to the fabric itself i cannot recommend and will be returning. ill look for something else. i havent bought from retailer in a dogs age and i hope the quality hasnt slipped - i will look for another option.,Negative

1944,You will love this cardigan. very well made with beautiful details. the sleeves have the same detail as the collar and the back. has darker flecks that will go well with dark pants or cords or jeans. you will love this cardi! wish it came in more springy colors. i only gave it a lower rating for quality because the first one i tried on had a sleeve that was much tighter than the other sleeve. the replacement was fine!!,Positive
1946,Cute skirt but i agree with the other reviewer. you cant get it on! i tried my skinny daughter tried no go!,Negative
1948,"I would definitely only recommend this top to girls who are smaller chested. it fits in the shoulders/arms, and then flares out too much at the bottom, almost looks like a maternity top. the material is very nice however - both soft, and feels like it will hold up through multiple washes.",Negative
1951,"I originally bought this dress in another color back when retailer was doing the 25% off dresses promotion a few months ago. i had seen it on a store associate at my local store and absolutely loved it, but hemmed and hawed at the original price. it was a splurge even at 25% off, but as soon as i put it on i was in love. this dress is so soft. i wore it to see some old friends, and after every hug i received a comment about how unbelievably soft it was! the material is thick enough to have a decen",Positive

1954,I thought it was only me and immediately assumed i needed to go on a diet when i attempted to put this adorable skirt on. it got stuck at my hips. im a very consistent size small in dresses and skirts. i actually thought about putting it on over my head but that was impossible. its going back. now i see the other reviews and am relieved that its the skirt and not me! wish i had read them before purchasing. retailer is going to get a lot of returns on this one.,Negative
1955,"I ordered this winth some trepidation as the dress looked a bit baggy on the model. i dont typically buy this style of dress because many times, they are unflattering on me. im 56 and 130 lbs, in very good shape. the small was perfect for me. a size up wouldve resulted in a baggier look. the length is perfect, above my knee; not too short, but short enough so i dont look frumpy. the dress drapes beautifully, and i can wear it with tights and boots now, and capri tights and wedge sandals in",Positive
1958,"Facing the mirror--near perfection. high waist emphasizes the narrowest part of the frame--pleats nicely hide any stomach flaws. color is an eye-catching deep mustardy perfection and the interlocking button pattern is creative and beautiful. the problem is the walk away. from that view, the skirt waist finishes just where theres a bit of extra flesh. the cut is more of a long a-line--fairly boxy--and the heaviness of the cotton maintains that structure, so while the look as you approach walking",Negative

2018,"There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine, but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. ive also found that they dont stay rolled up in the back, especially if you sit down. its a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down wouldve helped, but i doubt that wouldve fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.",Negative

2025,This dress runs large so i sized down. when it arrived i looked at it and thought the fabric was ugly and boring for a dress. it sat there for about two weeks till i tried it on. i love it! it is so comfortable and is so cute how the pockets hang. all it need is some long necklaces or a scarf to complete the look. i get complements on it everytime i wear it. my only complaint is that it peels under the arms a little bit.,Positive

2269,"I ordered this shirt online and just received it in the mail. the floral design is nice, but the mesh fabric in the back is low quality and cheapens the look of the shirt (especially considering the price). most disappointingly, the neck hole is almost as small as the arm holes. with no zipper or button opening i could not fit my head through the opening and, thus, could not even put the shirt on. needless to say, i will be returning it. i ordered the xs, so it is possible that larger sizes do n",Negative
2274,I found this blouse to be just a lovely spring and summer top. the netting in back adds interest and the dusky peach floral print is extremely pretty. the tiered layers add a slimming effect and it can be worn casual or for dress. it could even be worn in the fall with the right sweater. i just love it and feel so feminine when i wear it.,Positive

2282,"The dress looks great both in winter and summer, either paired with tights and a light jacket or on its own. it runs true to size--was able to buy it online. the fabric is great for all day wear--doesnt wrinkle too much.

2305,Im so sick of all workout tops being baggy. they look sloppy on my frame. this top is ultra soft and fits great! the black/white one looks more heathered grey in person. i ordered an xs as all tops lately are just huge on me. i should be a small and i will be returning for that proper size.,Positive
2306,"Dress caught my eye on the rack so i thought id try it on. the dress has lovely blue stripes (hard to discern in the online photo) which makes it a great year-round piece. however, like others have commented, it is too low to wear to work. will consider alternations to close the v-neck if the dress is marked down beyond its current sale price.",Negative
2308,I love this dress! it fits me so well and is extremely comfortable. i cant wait until it gets a little warmer so i can wear it with a trench and cute flats or heeled sandals.,Positive

2311,"First, i absolutely love cloth & stone. but lately im finding some of the styles are going in a direction that just doesnt fit my style. thats ok because they still have some good basics. 


what i mean is the cut. a lot of their pieces are super long in the back and super short in the front (ie their slip dress they have out right now). this particular tank is like that, although this one is borderline. the sides cut up a little too high for my tastes and i cant help but think im wearin",Negative

2322,"I agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such. this really does have a lot going on. i usually wear a 4 in skirts, and based on reviews, went up one size. it still saw way up near my chest - i think even an 8 would be too small! its sooooo tiny at the waist. probably buy 2 sizes, 2 and 3 sizes up from your own. also, the skirt flares super wide at the sides, it doesnt sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand. its like a skirt",Negative
2328,"First off, i love the dress! i love anything that you can throw on for a monday and be ready in 20 minutes. the material is good but the compartments for the bust do not hold a d+cup. i ordered the 6 and it fit perfectly except in the bust. easy fix, a white cami, the sale price makes that necessity acceptable. its a keeper.",Positive

2558,"This top is beautiful and special. the burnout velvet (so nice and soft), the flowers, the pretty metallic threads and even the back closures make it wonderful. i took my usual size 0. it is a bit more fitted on the bottom of the top (hip area) than i was expecting but not snug. i will wear this during the holidays and beyond! happy with my purchase and looking forward to wearing it!",Positive
2562,I wanted to love this tunic sweater. the material is so soft and a perfect weight. the color is pretty. bu the fit absolutely did not work for me. the tunic runs very small. a large usually fits me but i felt like i was wearing a small. the slits are quite high. i was sorry to do it but this one went straight back!,Negative
2564,Great item. ordered for my wife for christmas. received it and the medium petite waist size measured at approximately 26 (so it is at least 2 off the standard--and a thick material needs a bit more room to fit well). disappointed! replaced with next size up...well see!,Negative
2566,"This dress had so much potential. the top was absolutely gorgeous. my issue was with the bottom half of the dress. the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all. the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out, the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger. i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead.",Negative

2582,"I should have heeded the previous reviewers advice. but im really short so i thought id give it a try. there is something really wrong with the bust. first, its about 3-4 inches higher than it should be. the bottom trim cut across the middle of my bust. even if i hoisted everthing up in there to fit the cups, they are really only designed to fit cones, not curves. from the side it looked hideous. too bad, because the fabric and fit everywhere else is gorgeous.",Negative

2584,"Yay, i found it: my go-to dress for this summer! its perfect for casual day-to-day stuff, as well as summer festivals, nights out, travel, etc. i love the design, length and fit. its a bit snug in the chest area but i went with the smaller size as the shoulder straps sagged a bit in the larger size. the lace-up front gives it a sexy corset-type bodice, but in a very casual, appropriate way. i think this dress will work well with many body types and ages, its flattering for us curvier ladies,",Positive
2585,"I love this dress. i got it in the blue and i feel like everything about it is so modern and class and summery. it runs a bit on the small side. im between a 6 and an 8 - i went with the six, but its definitely tight. i have a larger chest, and its pretty low and sexy, though you could knot the laces at the top for a more modest neckline. ive also put shirts under it and its a super cute jumper. im 51 and the dress (regular, not petite) hits right below my knee.",Positive

2593,"I am now the third person to try this dress and return it for the same reason. the empire waist is too high and hits across the bust instead of underneath it. i cant imagine how they got it to fit this model so well. i am petite and i really love the idea of a maxi with sleeves, so i decided to try it even through the two previous reviewers reported this issue. unfortunately, i had the same problem. i am a c+ cup size. perhaps this would work on a very thin figure with a small bust. i ordered t",Negative

2599,"I ordered the white denim online and was very disappointed by how thin the material was. i had tried on the light blue denim in the store and it had a nice weight to it. the style is wonderful and the fit is very flattering, but too sheer for me to wear outside the house!",Negative

2608,"I actually love the fit of this t. the photo of the model does make it look more of a straight fit - but i love that it has more of a flared shape. the armholes are high enough that it covers that bit of arm chub i hate, it swings out enough that it looks a little dressy and a little more special than your basic t, and it drapes nicely even over my curvy shape.",Positive

2618,I agree with the other reviewer that the color of this top is more burgundy with purple undertones rather than a deep red like shown online. the fit was very boxy on me and it did not look flattering. i was not willing to to have it altered so i returned it.,Negative

2629,"When this dress first showed up online, i liked it, but didnt buy it because i wasnt in love. retailer weekend popped up, so i decided to take advantage of the 15% off and ordered this dress. it shipped to me in no time! the dress is beautiful. the fabric is soft and airy. this is the first off the shoulder dress that actually stays off the shoulder. no riding up, no fussing! i suggest sizing down because this dress is slightly flowy.",Positive
2630,This is such a cute top! ive learned to size down in swing tops or else they look way too big - in a sloppy way. i ordered the xxs (53 and 110lbs) and it fits well. itll look cute with my black skinny dress pants or jeans. i definitely recommend!!,Positive
2631,"Im curvy, and i often have trouble finding pants that dont have weird creasing and fit both my waist and thighs. these fit awesome, especially when i use the buttons at the waist to make it a little smaller. they do emphasize my hips, so if youre trying to hide hips, these arent for you. i love them, though--they drape beautifully and feel great.",Positive

2645,"Love these pants. they are so easy to wear and look really polished and put together. i bought all 3 colors but i had to go a size up so that they draped correctly on me. i am usually a 4 but bought a 6.

2665,This would be perfect except for the ridiculous attached scarf. the material is so soft and luxe. the colors are richer in person and perfectly go with everything. but the attached scarf ruins everything!! the scarf is not flattering and takes away form the cute buttons on the front. if the scarf could be removed it would be a great sweater coat. so disappointing.,Negative
2670,"Im pretty disappointed in these. just bought the yellow pair and wore today for the first time. super cute and very comfortable. i was in love with them. they got two small stains on them from the days activities ( and not even crazy, untreatable stains). unfortunately, the stains did not budge yet the color of the shorts washed out. they are completely ruined after one washing (on cold). im hoping this was a fluke and plan to order a second pair before they sell out. these will be going back",Negative
2675,"I love the way these shorts fit and look; very comfy, but after laundering one time, the lavender color became blotchy. used regular detergent in gentle cycle and it looks like someone poured bleach on them in random areas & they are unwearable! i have several colors, but the only color that was a problem is the lavender. $58 for one wear was a waste. i hate to leave negative feedback, but be careful with laundering.",Negative
2678,"I ordered this dress to wear for summer weddings this year. i am both surprised and excited that it fits.

i normally wear an 18, sometimes a 16. stores like retailer are a place i go to admire fun cloths, but not to actually shop. i was concerned that the xl was going to be a fake xl- this happens sometimes. a brand only makes clothing up to a 12, so theyre xl is really a 12. but not so! i feel like the xl could fit a 16 - 20. the l would probably fit a 16 as well.

this dress fits in",Negative
2679,"Love these shorts. they do run large, i wear a 29 in pilcro and the 28 in these shorts fit comfortably with a bit of room to spare. the turquoise is definitely green, and not as bright as what i see in the online photo, but still a nice color. they have a funny smell but im sure that will wash out.",Positive
2680,These are some of the softest most comfortable shorts i own and wish i had them in more colors. i like that i an adjust the length of the cuff since its not hemmed to a certain length. i ordered the pink/salmon color and they go with so much!,Positive
2681,"I was extremely excited to receive these pants, given the two positive reviews. im a petite woman and have trouble finding jeans with the right proportions. i sized down from my normal size (27 to a 26) and was swimming in these pants. i would have had to go down three sizes to make these work. im not sure if i received a defective pair or what, but be cautious ordering these pants.",Negative

2737,This skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing ive ever ordered from retailer. it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving. it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all. there are also weird stitching lines. one more thing that i didnt like about the skirt was that its a cream-ish color. not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt. its going back.,Negative

2791,"This is a beautiful piece that looks even better in person - a nice mix of modern and artistic, with just enough color and a flattering fit. my only concern is that it may get itchy throughout the day, especially at the neckline. if you can handle a little wool blend next to your skin, i would recommend it for style and fit.",Positive
2792,"This is great, lightweight top layer thats just right for the little evening chill in the summer when the sun goes down, or on a breezy day. its sheer, so it requires a bottom layer. the medium fits a little tighter across the shoulders and arms for me than it shows on the model, which i like.",Positive

2803,"Looks great on the model, but in actuality there is way too much fabric; what should be flowy and billowy looks like a tent (or a maternity top on a petite woman). it didnt matter which size, they all fit me disastrously. i love the look and i thought of keeping it and having it taken in, but theres too much fabric under the chest to make it an easy cut/alteration on the side seams. sometimes i wonder who comes up with these patterns, and if they pin the shirts back on the models. if you put a",Negative

2814,"Such a cute pattern, and i loved the fold-over design, but beware - there is not enough bottom coverage! i shouldve looked more closely at the photo - its pretty accurate in showing the bathing suit bottoms have limited rear coverage. a couple more inches of fabric wouldve really helped. im used to fuller coverage bathing suit bottoms, and these just expose way more cheek than i felt comfortable with. i could maybe wear them around my husband, but definitely not my dad! i felt like if i bent",Negative

2834,"This skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo. i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big, but nothing that affected the look of the skirt. the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together, almost like sunday school felt cut outs (but stiffer) (not a fan).. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple, and the color washed me out. definitely not worth the price (for me anyways). good luck!",Negative

2847,Love this coat. the colour is vibrant and it is well made. it does however run small. for me it was two sizes. i am usually a 00p and ended up purchasing the 2p. glad i tried it on in a store. it is a good spring/fall coat as it is lightweight. if i had purchased the 4p i could layer it a bit more. good but though. just be sure to size up.,Positive
2848,When these shorts arrived i loved them and was so excited to wear them on my upcoming trip to the beach. the high rise waist is very flattering and the material was extremely soft. the floral detailing was a little more orange than in the picture but i still loved the contrast. the first time i wore these i immediately noticed threads coming loose throughout the day. it was minor but still concerning for an item that was so costly. the real problem arose in the evening when i put on a jacket on,Negative

2907,I love this brand and the material of these shirts and have a ton similar and thought this was adorable with the sweet detail but it is super short and boxy and i felt uncomfortable with the length on me and it also made it so it wasnt so flattering on. such a bummer cuz its a sweet spin on a plain basic tee!,Negative

2915,"My first complaint is, this dress is pinned back so obviously in the video that when the model turns around (not all the way), you can see the pin in the back.  that should have been a clue that this dress isnt meant to fit anyone properly if it doesnt fit the model. i agree with another reviewer that the model in the still product photos sized up and up because the dress does not fit loosely in regular size nor is it that long.  you have to have a longer torso to pull off the top, or the fabr",Negative

2953,This is beautiful dress with great fit. i agree with other reviewers that the top is small but works well for my small bust size. the fabric is heavy giving the dress a more sophisticated feel.,Positive
2955,This dress you will want to try on in the store. it is very thick and stiff fabric. the whole front is embroidered and the big drawback for me is that waist seam. there is absolutely no give in that waist. this is not stretchy fabric and not easy for just any body type to wear. sad because it is very pretty on the rack!,Negative
2956,This is so amazing! the dress is solid and will go under many different jackets kimonos and sweaters!,Positive

2974,"I like this top because it covers the bum.  it is a little longer in the back than front.  it is cotton modal soft, and it is light enough for summer.  the ruffles add nice flow and fun detail. i bought this piece because it will make a nice top to wear in the summer, but classier than a tank top.  i also knew it would make a nice layering piece under a sweater in the winter.  i buy all my clothing pieces now based on versatility, material (for comfort), and classical style.",Positive
2975,"I really wanted to love this dress, but it just didnt fit in anyway. i ordered an xs petite, and it was very large. the lacing in the back is completely useless, and thats what i liked about the dress. i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top (because of chest) and then lace more tightly near the waist. it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering. beautiful fabric, great color combo, bad fit.",Negative

3083,A really great basic that can be styled a number of ways. i bought it in tan and white and received many compliments on it. the slightly off the shoulder look is really flattering and perfect for a spring or summer look.,Positive
3085,Love this top the crossover design is so cute. i ordered by normal xs (55 110 lbs) and was worried it wouldnt fit right in the chest (34 d) but it does and even though its cut on the lower side its made so there is no gap in the shirt when you bend over. has a little elastic in there to keep everything together. perfect length and nice thicker material got the navy and red stripe and with white jeans is so cute!,Positive

3393,Although the blouse is pretty it did not fit me well. i downsized two sizes and it still didnt hang well on my body. i think it looks great on the model and would probably look better on a thinner person. i am disappointed it did not work out and i will be returning it.,Negative

3429,I am two months postpartum and bought this top to have something to wear for a date night. it is so flattering and has a beautiful cut. loose but not baggy or unflattering. i bought a small but could have probably sized down... so theres a decent amount of wiggle room in the sizing. great length for jeans or leggings.,Positive
3431,"Really love this sweater. i am pretty crushed im returning it. the flair below the waist is too much. the quality is wonderful, the color lovely, the style great- i wore it around the house and every time i caught a mirror, it just was too much material, too big a bell shape. oh well, still looking for the sweater for winter 2016/17.",Negative

3460,"Thank you, retailer, for creating this sweetly vintage and feminine sweatercoat. the boiled wool is lovely and the embroidery makes me lightheaded just looking at it. this is definitely a nod to retailers past, and i love it to bits! 
i usually wear a size s or xs, but bought this in the xs. the fit is flattering as can be. i was so happy to find a fitted and timeless piece in the sea of boxy and trendy sweaters.

3476,"Love the fabric on this. so many retailer tops sit unworn in my closet because they are sheer and i have to wear a layer underneath. this will not be one of those. the fabric is beautifully embroidered and thick enough that it doesnt feel too delicate. the back is a super soft jersey....feel wonderful! will go nicely with jeans & flats for me! as a super bonus, i bought it with my birthday discount and now have in in time for a downton abby party. :) ill be so pretty!",Positive

the description does not say lined, and i hoped for soft wool that i recently got on the yellow with white piping sweater coat. this is hard, coarse, itchy wool - impossible for me to wear an unlined garment. i am consistently puzzled by the high prices for garments that are unlined when they really need to be. it went back, and i cannot really recommend this as i know i am not the only",Negative
3491,I took a chance and ordered extra one for my daughter-without ever running it by her first. id first seen the sweater in the store when another customer was tracking it down. it looked so nice and unique i couldnt forget about it even though i didnt try it on at the time. very happy i got it on sale-and so i got two-luckily we go to our different workplaces in different towns!,Positive

3499,This top is one of my retailer faves! it is so comfortable and love the quality and design. i receive many compliments on this top. i usually wear an xs or s in retailer tops and the xs was a little tight in the arms. the dressing room attendant suggested ordering a petite small so i wouldnt lose the shape. so glad i did. it fits perfect! i even ordered when it was on sale!! the gray color is perfect! its not too thick or thin.,Negative

3521,"I am on the fence about this one. the length is great. it hits right above my knee at 51. overall it was larger than i was hoping. the waist is pretty loose, and i really had to tightly tie the back to get s good shoulder fit. the bottom is very voluminous making me look wide. i wish they had it in a petite size. for this price, i will probably return it. its not worth the 300 price tag.",Negative
3524,"This dress looked like something i would wear and covet for years. unfortunately it was loose in the places where it should show shape and was tight in others. the bodice is incredibly small and not meant for bigger chested women. while the fabric is beautiful, overall the dress did not look like much. disappointed.",Negative

3731,Very comfy versatile skirt. the fabric is soft and stretchy that feels really nice on. i live in hawaii so i like having skirts to wear that work well with the climate but not typical of the fashion out here. the pleating is very flattering and the skirt layer underneath makes it wearable to work.,Positive

it runs quite large, in my opinion. im 57 and about 130-135lbs. the small was huge on me in the chest and shoulders/arms. the stomach also wasnt very fitted. the material is thinner than i expected (you can see through the dress to some extent when you hold it up to the light), but i dont think this is a problem, necessarily. had it been thicker, it probably would be too warm. but you might need a slip",Negative

3997,"Guess i shouldve looked at the pictures more closely. i ordered the white version and in the pictures you cant see that the sleeves are split - and it barely shows in the picture for the blue version. it also wouldve helped if the detail of the sleeves were noted in the item description. anyway, i will be returning this top because i dont like the way the sleeves look each time i bend my arms. looks a bit pirate-like to me.",Negative

perfect fit and very good quality.",Positive
4018,I so wanted to love this top. i first ordered in the medium because previous reviews said it ran large. i got the medium and it ran so small in the arms that i could almost not get it off with ripping it. so i ordered an xl hoping that would work. unfortunately it ran just as small im the arms and i had to return.,Negative
4021,"I love this dress. i got the coral, and its clean and simple, but with visually interesting lines. the top is a slightly heavier, stretchy fabric (no zippers or closures), while the skirt is made of a lighter fabric that gives it a bit of flirty swing. the hem is also slightly a-symmetrical, which i didnt notice from the online pictures. its a very comfortable dress that i could see being very versatile - dressed up for work, dressed down for daytime weekend wear, or even for date night.

4028,When i returned this the salesperson asked what was wrong w it bc it keeps being returned. i got the black w the white collar/cuffs. i thought it was terribly itchy material (which could be remedied w a shirt underneath) but the white collar part was such a dull ugly white-dirty color. maybe the other colors are better?,Negative
4031,"So the other review complained that there are slits on the sleeves of this blouse. yes, that is true. however, i love that about this blouse! i tried this blouse on in the store so the slits were not a surprise to me, but i can understand how they may upset a customer who wasnt expecting them. i think the slits are elegant and are in no way obtrusive or revealing. you could totally still wear this blouse to work or a nice dinner. i love it because its unique enough to be worn alone and simple i",Positive

4044,This is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area. it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area. the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves. it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what. but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it.,Negative

4083,This sweater is gorgeous. ordered in the grey motif. was as described and wonderfully soft. i tried it on with just a tank top underneath and did not find the material scratchy at all. i ordered the small size and felt it ran a tad on the large side however not enough to feel like i needed to return for an xs. looking forward to the colder months!,Positive
4086,"I absolutely love this jacket! it is the softest jacket i own. the collar takes this to the next level. i wasnt sure i would like the collar but after trying it on, i love it. im so confused as to why the pockets are partially sewn together. its weird but according to the other reviews, i am hoping to open the pockets up completely. i really should have gotten a medium in this coat. i am usually between a small and medium and this is a little on the smaller side. i bought this one on sale so",Positive

1- it was to short. i am 58 and it was really really short on me. i could not sit down in it. 
2- i found that it ran large. ive lost some weight recently, so perhaps ive gone down a size, but the medium was like a sack on me.

4295,I took a chance buying online. im thrilled this dress clings at the top and releases where it should (below the bust) without looking like a tent. a very classy dress for work or play. just hope it holds up after a wash as the material is thin (but opaque). love this dress.,Positive

i went to put on this dress for my rehearsal dinner the night before my wedding. my fiance and i tried in vain for 20 minutes to try to zip it up... and then it broke. the part that was zipped became unzipped and the zipper had no where to go. it was awful. i co",Negative

4303,"Outstanding dress. looks like a class that i will wear for many events to come. i couldnt decide which color way i liked in this dress----the red/white or the green, so i purchased both. i can see myself wearing the red into early fall and the green is a very springtime/summer dress. yes, the cut runs small but i dont think it is as small as some of the other reviews. i typically wear i size 6, and this one the 8 fit perfectly, so maybe one size up.",Positive

4316,"I bought this online so didnt realize that the fabric at the bottom is very, very stiff. i was expecting something silky, or at least on the softer and more moveable side. the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt. that being the case, it kind of juts out in weird places. the sweater part is very nice, but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture. the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o",Negative

4389,"I wanted to like this dress, but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose, does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy, so if you are well-endowed, your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result, the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model), and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves, this would likely be very flattering, but",Negative

4565,"I wore this for a few hours, and while it i got compliments i ended up needing to return it after the seams opened up over the shoulder blades. the fabric is so fine that during the normal goings-about of my day it gave way. and no, i didnt buy too small, and the fabric didnt pull while i was driving or reaching for anything.",Negative
4567,"I got this shirt as a gift. its cute and very comfortable. it is,however, a little thin so you may need to wear something underneath.",Positive
4569,"I purchased this in blue. it has a soft fabric and seems well made. i have worn it several times and think it is quite comfortable. i bought one size up due to comments on the site, but my daughter thinks i should have stuck to the size chart.",Positive
4573,I absolutely loved this top. it fit great and was easy to dress up or down. i wore it once and washed it according to the tag. cold water and flat dry. it is now 4 sizes too small and unwearable. extremely disgusted.,Negative

4575,I love maeve designs in general and find that their sizing and quality is consistent. this top is so soft and a bit billowy.. the darker pattern in the black motif combined with the lightweight nature of the material make it perfect for fall. i love the little details: staggered/ paired buttons down the front and interesting seaming that isnt as apparent in the photos. considering another color as well...,Positive
4578,"Great spring time dress that looks good with a thin top, a cardigan or by itself. the fit is a bit loose but not oversized in my usual size, so if you want a slimmer silhouette or you are not busty, i would size down. love the fabric as it has some give despite its thickness. i would have paid full price but im lucky to have purchased on sale.",Positive
4585,"I love the look of this dress but the length feels a little awkward which might be my height (54). im thinking about having it altered, not sure if i will do that or return it. i love the colors and the back cut out, it may be a better length for taller individuals.",Negative

4594,"The fit, once you get it on is as flattering as can be. its beautiful quality is undeniable. the problem and its a big one...you cant get it on without destroying your nails. the beautiful little buttons running up the bodice are impossible to get done and undone. dear designer, you forgot the zipper. sincerely, women everywhere. i loved it so much but just couldnt buy an outfit that was going to take me 20 minutes to put on and since it is a jumper it would be a process throughout wearing",Negative

4604,"I really wanted to like this but the fit was just off. it made me look like i was very pregnant and i usually wear loose and flowy tops too. this one was just too much material. i am usually an xs and that was the right size for me. i thought about taking to a seamstress and having some of the material taken in, but decided in the end to return because i just didnt love it. the pink color and the fabric are nice,  though there were several hanging threads too which is why i gave quality a 3.",Negative
4605,"As others mentioned, you have to unbutton all tiny buttons to put on and off... i do hope this gets easier with use... but - gorgeous and flattering as all get out! :-) i love the design in the back, and the little annoying buttons are sooo cute. the cut is super flattering, and classy. i can wear this to work, or out, just dont drink too much water ladies.... i am 115 lbs and 30dd chest, and the 0 petite was perfect. seriously, beautiful... so torn (keeping it for now!)",Positive
4607,"This top makes you feel like you should be in the tropics sipping a frosty cocktail. fabric is soft, not too sheer. im usually an xs and thats what i kept in this top. armholes not too low as in some. for reference, 54, 123 lbs",Positive

4609,"This romper fit like a dream!  it is gorgeous, unique, and sexy. i am rating this 2 stars because it took me 20 minutes to try it on!  there is no zipper and the only way to get it on and off is by buttoning and unbuttoning the small buttons on the top. nobodys got time for that!!!!  i wanted so desperately to wear it to my friends 40th birthday party. but i imagined myself spending half the night in the restroom trying to get this romper on and off. no thank you!  i considered buying the romp",Negative

4617,"I just received this and wore it immediately - it is cute even under a cardigan because the pattern peeks out, giving some depth to an otherwise plain white shirt. the material is soft and sort of on the thin side but not see-through. it is a fine knit, and has a satin-like thread to it which makes it soft and cool - perfect for a summer day! it is not as slim on me as the model but i am very petite (51 100 lb) and i think this would run closer to tts.",Positive
4618,"I was so excited to receive this jumpsuit as it looks so elegant and i love the lattice back. as soon as it arrived i set about unbuttoning it to try it on. 10 minutes and 2 broken fingernails later i got done. when i tried it on i found that it fit everywhere except the bust which was much too tight and i am not a busty person. so back it goes. even if it had fit, i do not think i could have handled the hassle of those buttons. why they didnt design it with a hidden zipper on the side and kept",Negative
4621,Overall the top is cute . what doesnt show in the photo are the pleats on the shoulder/neck area. the placement of the pleats makes you look like you have a football player neck . the neck area doesnt lay flat but comes off as puffy at your neck. ive never seen pleats placed in such a spot. ruined an otherwise cute top,Negative
4627,"I purchased the blouse in both the ivory and black. the black i decided to keep because it will go with anything. i was hoping the ivory blouse would work but its thin and see through. if someone could please tell me where i could find a casual, white or ivory blouse that is not entirely see through i would greatly appreciate it!",Negative
4628,I purchased the orange version (definitely orange - not red) before heading out on vacation and it was perfect for hot summer weather. the swingy shape keeps you cool and the print is much better in person. the fabric is very soft and hangs well. look forward to wearing to work also with a cardigan. i own a few akemi + akin tops and always get a s. this one seemed a bit large even in s but i liked the length so kept the s.,Positive

4630,"This jumpsuit is so cute and it looked amazing on. i had to return it because of the poor design. it was extremely hard to put on and take off! there are so many buttons to do and undo which are not as easy as snaps! the fabric buttons definitely make a great look to the jumpsuit but there should be a zipper on the side for easy access, or use snaps instead of the loops for the fabric buttons. what a shame of a lovely and classy design on a good quality material, but not worth it if its difficu",Negative
4631,"This tank is super amazing. very versatile - wore to work with dress pants and flats, and wore out to dinner with jeans and heels. a bit out of my comfort zone since it is a swing tank, but love the color and cut! perfect for professional life and going out on the town. i did choose a petite in this due to the long armholes (even though i have a long torso for my body size).",Positive

4641,I agree with all of the reviews. the design and fit are wonderful if you can get it on.! the buttons are a nightmare! whoever made these clesrly sewed the loopholes on the buttons closed with no thought as how to open them or get them off. ridiculous! they need to put a side zipper on this as i will probably check into since i really want to keep it. so so so disappointing,Negative

4673,"Ive been wanting to buy a romper that was easy to wear and take off and i like this one for many reasons. the elastic waist holds the romper in place when you take the top off, the top comes off easily bc its a halter and the design is very chic and sophisticated. the only down side is the tie is really heavy if you tie it in the back. its better to tie it in the front like the model in this picture. it is a bit long (comes down to my ankles) but looks good with heels.",Positive

4705,I was very disappointed with my recent retailer order. i ordered the meleri eyelet tank and it had a stain on the front. i also order a dress that came with a tear in the fabric. sale items should not be damaged unless the customer is aware of the damage and accepts it in that condition. very disappointing.,Negative

4925,This top turned out to be better than expected! im a large girl and the length is enough to cover my hips and the shirt it not tight at all. the embroidery details are lovely too. i bought this for a trip to italy this summer because it is cotton and because i consider it to be a classic piece being that it is black and white. one nice feature is this top does not have to be worn off shoulder. it looks just great with the sleeves up.,Positive

4991,"As stated in my review title, theyre amazing! theyre incredibly well made, have just the right amount of stretch, and are so flattering. i think the boot cut makes them look like pants rather than leggings. they can definitively be worn to work, or at least where i work, where the dress code is business casual. my only issue is the length, which being at 53 isnt surprising. theyre about 3 inches too long. im a size 8-10 and got the large. i couldnt recommend these enough",Positive

5196,I love this top! i originally bought the brown/purple pattern and wore it all the time so when i saw the blue and yellow on sale i had to get it. the fabric is really soft and breezy - perfect for the spring to summer weather. the sleeves are a little long on me but doesnt bother me. it runs a little large but works with my style. i would have sized down but it wouldnt have fit in the bust (im a 36d). i definitely recommend this top!,Positive

5461,So sure from the online shop & images that i ordered two pairs. the package arrived in less than 2 days and immediately i could see how the cords were everything i expected them to be. so incredibly soft and body forming and has a classic cord texture only softer. i love them ! this look works both daytime as well as evening - its geared to work with any casual to couture look. my 22 year old niece wanted to buy the second pair (sz 28) from me so i gave them to her. shes a nice niece : ),Positive
5464,"I am really into this jacket! the fit is nice although it does very slightly large; however, not enough to go down a size for me. all of the different textures are really cool and the details do seem to be pretty slimming, which is always a bonus. i am a bit worried that the wool will pill like crazy though. lets hope im wrong and that it lasts!",Positive

3. i ordered both a medium (size 10) and a large (size 14) , and neither hung right. the m too tight, and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves.

5799,"I wanted to love this dress. the cut, fit and color are adorable. unfortunately the fabric is super thin. due to the material type it can be clingy in a manner that requires the anti-static spray your mom used to use in the 80s. i was on the fence of keeping it, but if there is so much as a wrinkle in your panty-line the whole world will see it. i would hate to have to wear a slip with this due to static issue. i am most likely going to return it; even at 15% off, it is over-priced for the cheap",Negative

5805,"The fabric is absolutely lovely on these, but very thin. the top part was tighter than usual (and i sized up from my regular pilcro jean size) and they flare a lot. so the thin, tight top was not a flattering look. the rise also felt short.

5846,This darling dress has a fun boho vibe to it and the color/pattern would flatter a variety of skin tones. a long necklace is a must with this dress. it has a flowy drape below the waist so its a generous fit. i purchased the medium.,Positive
5847,I ordered this in xs and s. they both fit very well and i couldnt tell much difference between the two. i kept the s as it seemed to have a little more length on it. i am 54 about 120#. i wish this were offered in lots of different solids and more patterns (the taupe and white stripe...hint hint hint) too. its just perfect. i am in my mid 40s and have young kids so its great for my life right now! comfortable too!,Positive
5850,I was so excited to receive this sweater in the mail since my local store didnt carry it. it is a very cute design if you have a smaller frame but im curly up top and it didnt lay they way it did on the model. theres plenty of stretch. unfortunately the fabric sheds and itches terribly. you could wear a shirt underneath but id have to wear a turtleneck so itll be going back.,Negative

6022,"I ordered a size 4, my usual size in tops is s or xs for looser fitted tops, i prefer a more fitted look. for reference i am 54 120 lbs,, 32d. i ordered in pink and the color matches the online image. the pink is shear and i do have to wear a camisole underneath, which does not bother me at all. the top is adorable with jeans or slacks for work.",Positive
6023,"My hips are very narrow and i dont have much of a waistline. in a-line skirts and anything that sits below the waist, i wear a size 6. skirts like this with a defined waist almost never work for me because of the waistline. if this is typically your style of skirt, i think it will run large because the waistline is more generous than usual.

6024,"I really liked this top when i saw it in yellow but i was on the fence about ordering it for a while. when i did order it i chose the pink at the last second. i love it. ive worn it several times with a pair of jeans and cardigan. it travels nicely in the suitcase, no need to pull the iron out. i wear a cami underneath but its really not that sheer so you dont need to. its a lovely piece",Positive

6030,This top is perfect for summer. it delivers style without the bulk. the peplum hit perfect for my 54 frame. unfortunately it was too low cut in the front. i had to return it.,Negative
6032,Purchased this top at my local store. usually dont pay full price for clothing but had to have this top. so cute and lightweight. love that you do not need to wear a cami underneath and has material that covers your bra. usually wear a petite size due to tops being cut so low but a regular medium was perfect. suggest purchasing this top full price or if still around when it goes on sale definitely purchase. i bought the floral design.,Positive

it is very pretty but once on, it fit the wrong way. i got a small because i know that this designer tends to run tight across the bust.

6668,"Like a previous reviewer mentioned the jeans do not necessarily look like the one in the photo. i first ordered them in my regular size and also had to notice that they are cut like mens jeans with legs so skinny that i could only force them over my calves. the embroiding is beautiful, but it also stops the material from stretching, so the the super skinny legs are a real problem. also, they are not as intensely stone washed as shown in the picture. i decided to order them again one size bigger",Negative

6712,I love the look of this dress and i love the way it is cut. the one thing i do not love is the thickness of the material. it is just too much for a summer dress. it just felt heavy and hot. i still love this brand so i am hopeful for a few more great options to come out before summer is over.,Negative

as the previous reviewer said, much lighter than the picture!
rise and inseam are as described but with the light denim they combined to make a bad look for this 40something. maybe for a younger audience who like the 90s retro vibe?

7554,"This sweater is a lovely color and very soft. however, the sweater sheds terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance. its also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through.",Negative
7555,"Beautiful, comfortable and attractive sweater! my neckline doesnt stay flat as the one in the photo does, but i love the sweater anyway. great quality, attractive, and comfortable.",Positive
7563,The material is very nice. not flimsy at all which is nice. the problem was the fit around the arms. i am a petite person with a small chest but it still didnt cover me bra. ill be returning it.,Negative
7566,"I really like both colors in this top. i love the way it lays, the length, the material, etc. what i dont like is that the arm holes are very large and shows the entire side of your bra. this is definitely a summer top so why would someone want to have to wear a cami when its warm enough to go sleeveless? too bad, i would have bought it for sure.",Negative
7567,"I got the taupe and loved it so much i ordered the white and wore both this week alone! they are so cute and a great weight in this spring/summer weather were having in the bay area. 
the taupe is a normal medium and a bit roomy, so ordered the white in a medium petite and its pretty great. just depends upon how you like to wear it - both are lovely. 

my advice? get two - today! you wont regret it. 
order your regular size - dont size up or down!",Positive
7568,"Great tunic top! is longer than i thought it would be so i probably could have sized down, definitely covered my butt! but overall a great print and cute top. loving it!",Positive

7573,"This top is very nice. i ordered it in black, it looked very good. the embroidery and pleated details give it a very nice look. the fabric, however, feels like heavy cotton. it didnt feel very soft and comfortable, it was a bit hard for me to wear because i usually prefer soft cotton. while i think this will retain its shape and not stretch like softer cotton, i am sending it back. it felt a bit heavy to wear.",Negative

7578,"Great looking shirt that i bought for my wife, but poor quality. the fit is great but the buttons literally keep falling off. first time my wife wore it two buttons just fell off. when she was sewing them back on she showed me and another button just came off with the slightest tug. its really too bad because it looks great otherwise.",Negative
7580,I picked this dress up to take into the dressing room to try on without looking at the price tag. im typically a small and he dress in store was an xs but because of the wrap i figured id try it anyway. this dress is to die for! the xs fit me just fine (though the snap at the chest wouldnt stay closed but i thought it looked ok). i looked at the tag after falling in love with the dress but left the store without it. im contemplating purchasing it still because i cant stop thinking about it!!,Positive

7587,"I got this in a petite xs; its gorgeous and incredibly soft, great quality as well. my one little caveat is that its very short; im 51 with a short torso and it still didnt get very far on me, but if you wear it with high-waited pants/skirt its not a big deal",Positive
7591,"The top is quite lovely and good quality. i ended up getting a size 4, which fit similarly to the model photos. i am smaller up top and wide in the hips, but the shape worked well for my shape.",Positive
7592,"I think this dress is my favorite purchase this whole year! it fits like a dream! i saw it in the store while it was full price and tried on an 8 (the only size they had left!). i typically wear a 6 or 8 in dresses, but the 8 was quite large, so i passed. after it went on sale, i ordered a 6 with my fingers crossed! glad i ordered when i did, as they sold out fast! fabric is a nice substantial weight, great for fall! the fit is great, not tight at all and more of an a-line on me, which is weird",Positive

7604,"I love the way this top looks in the picture and the embroidery is as lovely as it appears--very detailed. it is both subtle (not cheap looking) and special.

as an earlier reviewer noted, the top is not see-through, a plus.

the drawbacks, though, mean that i will be returning this top. 

1. the fabric is very heavy and does not drape well. i am a small woman with a large chest and ordered a size 0. the top is still loose, even in that size, and the relative stiffness of the fabric gives",Negative
7605,"I was so looking forward to receiving this in the mail! when it arrived, i was very disappointed. the color is more mauve than dusty pink, and the fabric is stiff and wrinkled.....not at all what i expect velvet to be (flowy and soft). the fabric seems very cheap for the price point.  i usually like floreat, but this one is headed right back to the store!",Negative
7606,"I tried this sweater on and  loved it immediately! its super soft and comfortable, and very slimming. i tried my normal size s and an xs, and decided on the xs as the s gave it (and me!) a bit of a wider look. love the navy color!",Positive
7607,"The positive: light-weight fabric, interesting drape

the negative: im tall and would have preferred if it was longer. the big drawback is the ridiculous buttons--three fell off the first time i wore it...and it fits loosely! theyre held on by a single loop...ugh.",Negative
7609,"A 3-season top that compliments jeans, dress pants, shorts & skirts. light-weight and double layered (so should you go without a bra the girls have protection). emphasizes nice shoulders, length just covers any belly flaws. im a 6-8 and could have gone small or medium here.",Positive
7610,"Beautiful print, however as the previous reviewer mentioned it is very sheer, much sheerer than the product shot shows. i was expecting to be able to wear a nude bra under this without a cami, however my nude bra was completely visible.
the top also ended at the middle of the zipper of my jeans, so much shorter than the tunic length shown, and the bottom half of the sleeves ballooned out much more noticeably in person (the top half of the sleeves are slim, and the bottom half are looser).

7614,"This shirt is adorable.
but...it didnt work for me!
im a smaller gal with a large chest (54, 34g). i tried on the small, since it seemed so flowy and large. the sleeves were tight, yet the back of the shirt flowed way too much, making the shirt look huge on me. perhaps a more fitted back, and i would have been in love.
love the blue color!",Negative
7617,"This blouse is the definition of how to wear plaid and not feel like a lumberjack.. living in l.a. its 90 degrees one day, and 60 the next. the lightweight fabric is perfect for our ever changing climate. it runs true to size and is very comfy. thinking of wearing it for thanksgiving dinner.",Positive

7620,"I do not think i could express how much i love this top! it is so flattering and soft. i love that the bottom half is slightly sheer and a different fabric than the top. it is stretchy, which for me is a wonderful thing. i purchased the day it came in store. it is quickly prone to pilling though!! with the style of shirt its not so bad, but kind of unfortunate for a top that is almost $100.",Positive
7622,"I feel like i have a lot of blouses like this so it really needed to wow me to keep it. and while it is lovely, well made and very pretty and delicate...i just didnt feel like it was anything special. if you dont have a blouse like this, then it is a great find. but it is nothing super out of the ordinary... fit i feel is tts...i am in between a m and l...i ordered the l. lots of room in the body although i didnt like where the arms hit on me. they arent wrist length but they arent mid-fore",Positive
7624,"The top on the model in the photo is a true ivory, but the top in reality is more beige. well, im blonde with fair skin, so im not sure this is going to work. it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality, with it really being beige, having pleats everywhere, and being a crinkly fabric, it looks more casual. i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts",Negative

7638,I love this top! the top has nice details and is not too sheer. it did have a smell at first but thats gone now.,Positive
7642,I am a petite person with broad shoulders and got this in a size small. i absolutely love it! it is similar to how it looks online but is even better in person. you could wear this with just about anything. so glad i bought it.,Positive

7647,I ended up ordering this in a petite online after trying it on in store. i found the regular length to be a bit too long and flowy and i preferred it to be more tailored. its very cute and on trend. cant wait to wear it with some dark flare jeans!,Positive
7653,"Nice design but very wrinkly fabric that doesnt fall well. also, as has happened to me before, retailer sent me a dress clearly worn/used and returned by someone else with hair all over it. you would think they would at least look at returned dresses to make sure that the returned clothes were free of stains and hair before they send them out.",Negative
7656,"Its a rather boring tank. i thought itd be perfect under a cardigan for work, but decided against it. the fit is boxy, and does not look good on a girl with curves.",Negative
7659,Definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt. just too large; too much fabric for me. im usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod. i wouldnt have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top. i think the colors are also a bit duller in person. love the concept though!,Negative
7665,"I am 52 107lb and an xs petite.the embroidery was the only nice thing about this dress, but everything else was really unflattering -- the huge puffy sleeves especially. another reviewer said this was more like a shift, and she was right. not worth the price on sale.",Negative

7685,"With a skirt so vibrant, its hard not to feel happy wearing it. i tried this on in store, following a spring fashion show. while i usually need petite sizes for length/proportion purposes (im 54, slender build), the regular size 2 was a great fit and length. any shorter and it may have taken a bit of the elegance away from the skirt (and i dont necessarily mind a shorter length, but this was beautiful as it was). the price is a bit steep, but the quality of the material justifies it. the one",Positive

clothing and this cape does not disappoint. it is absolutely beautiful....chic and elegant.",Positive
7688,"I love this skirt for so many reasons! 
one, it isnt a circle skirt, per se, which is good. i am hip heavy and dont need extra volume at my hips. so while its called a circle skirt, the description states that its a-line. based on that, i was willing to risk it. also, i am 55 and tend to stay away from above the knee dress and skirt lengths (just my personal preference). although i am only 52 i ordered the regular size 10 for the extra length and its exactly at my knee; perfect for me.",Positive

this top is cut like a square and fits wide which is not apparent in the photo. definitely not for me.",Negative

7703,"I so wanted to love this sweatshirt. it is very soft and seems like excellent quality and material. the pattern is pretty, and i envisioned spending hours cuddled up reading in it. unfortunately, the body of the sweatshirt (particularly the front torso area) was too big, and it popped out around me like a balloon. the arms fit well, so i dont think that i could have gone down a size. i was also not keen on the way the neck hung, which was either very stiff and tall around my neck when unfolded",Negative
7706,I was surprised by the other reviews. expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward. the hi-low cut with so much bulk just wasnt flattering. i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body. the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more. it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as id hoped. it went back.,Negative
7712,Fits like a maternity top. not for my age group or build.,Negative

7752,"Tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece, but the quality is below average for an retailer dress. its just a shapeless, thin, beach cover-up that i couldve picked up anywhere. the yellow color is so cute though. if youre looking for a light, breezy, go-to-the-beach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel, this might be good for you, but its too thin for just about anything else.",Negative

7773,This is super cute and the colors are so vibrant and its thin enough to wear with tanks for the summer but it already had a hole forming in the upper back shoulder.  i guess the material was a little too thin....$98 is a little too much money for something that gets holes so easily!,Negative

i absolutely love the fabric and the bottom of it. sadly, the top was just too balloon like and poofed out way too much. i tried putting a belt with it which helped a little bit. if the top had been just a little more fitted this would be awesome. i dont know if a smaller size would have helped the issue... i ordered a small and considered an xs but in the end just returned it.",Negative
7829,The dress is absolutely beautiful in person. the blue stripes are a bit brighter and the print on top is more muted. its unique and sure to turn heads. being 52 i tried on the small petite. this size is usually perfect (lengthwise) for me. however this dress was about 2 too long. another complaint is the style of the top half. the model in the picture seems to be hiding the puffiness of the top half. the top half puffs out and made me appear much wider than i am. not a good look on anyone.,Negative
7831,"This may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried. the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo, absolutely garish. the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties, it just looks cheap. the skirt is an antebellum nightmare.

7838,"I love jumpsuits for their style and comfort. i loved the look of this blue silky piece, and the review that said it was like lounge wear you could wear out of the house. i agree that it is like lounge wear, but for me, there were a few challenges.

first, the fit was small. i am usually anywhere between a 2 and a 6 depending on style, cut and brand. i tried the small in this and it was not a flowy look or feel. it was restrictive in the hip area in a way that would make me not want to wear th",Negative

wanted to love this as the style is very cute but was disappointed by the mate",Negative
7871,I bought this dress on super sale and it was such a great deal. sadly its going back although i sized down i still feel like the dress is shapeless and tent like. no wonder why the store had so many still at the price i paid. the details on the dress are pretty and its high quality. just wish the fit was better.,Negative

first off, the seam that is in both the front and back of the shirt is much more pronounced than in the photo. secondly, there is no shape whatsoever, unlike in the photo. it bells out like a tent. it honestly looks like a shirt you would buy if you were trying to appear pregnant when not. overall, this shirt is an insult to the female form.

wearable as casual or dressed up
solid plain color

9281,I was surprised retailer decided to ship this sweater. the sweater looks like its falling apart and it is huge. i would not recommend this even at a clearance price.,Negative
9285,Colors and patterns of this dress are beautiful and thats where it ends. cheap flimsy polyester and no lining. far too expensive for what it is. on me it bulked out in my chest area and did not look so great. i would say it runs a tad big but in my case ( i have wide shoulders) not big enough to downsize. too bad because i really love the colors and idea of this dress.,Negative
9286,Love the fabric that c s uses--so very soft and pliable.  fit is tts with room for draping over figure flaws and great for layering while open.  but the high-low hem is far more extreme than the new action shots show.  im kind of over this trend but at the same time love this shirt dress.  im 53 140# 36d and tried on m but will order mp online because of length.,Positive

9305,I had such high hopes for this top. it is beautiful but it is very uncomfortable! the lace/beadwork is extremely itchy. the button at the neck seems cheap and i was worried it would fall off. the beadwork and lace puckered on my shoulders making the fit off for me.,Negative

9337,Sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is. i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life. this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style. another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $5.00!!!,Negative

9397,I think this t-shirt is so cute. simple but cute. i originally ordered this in medium. i washed and wore it once but realized it was really too big. my normal size is small so i reordered it. it is slightly shear for my taste so i do wear a cami underneath. i plan to wear this to my 2 year olds gymnastics class. it is little yoga people but close enough! i normally hang dry all my clothes from retailer as they can be quite delicate but the first one i washed did wash well.,Positive
9398,"Cute in theory, i love the bright colors, the tied black collar sash and the 70s vibe, however, the fabric is cheap, and the worst part in my view is that the seams that run along the front center of the shirt do not align the pattern. maybe this was intentional, but with the shirt i received, it looked horrible. i sent it back. i notice in the picture that the black ties are strategically placed over the center front seam, so it is a bit deceiving. i wouldnt buy this top at any price based on",Negative

very disappointed. i already returned this.",Negative

sizing is true to size, i tried on the regular size, not petite, and it was fine (my usual 0 or 2, went with 0 as tjhis top is a looser fit, 2 would be boxy). the lace part is a nice added detial, the plaid is soft flannel. color is a salmon colr, with navy, but the dominant color washed me out (i am fair). love it otherwise!",Positive

9700,Starts out crisp but not too tight. doesnt over-stretch through the course of the day. very comfortable but looks polished. front pockets sewn together like all verdugo jeans: good particularly because it eliminates the awkward brighter white where actual pockets would show through fabric on other white jeans. washes exceptionally well and holds its shape as well as softness; which is good because being white they pick up stains easily. be careful with underwear lines- thong probably best.,Positive

9744,"This dress ran large--maybe because the pleats made this dress too roomy. the dress hung on my right shoulder but the dress did not hold up at all on the left side of my body, maybe because i have a short torso/petite frame. i loved the yellow color for summer--it would have made for a nice dress to wear for a wedding. unfortunately, i had to return it.",Negative

perfect lightweight material in this summer heat.

overall, i wouldnt recommend this dress for the curren",Negative

the overdress is fairly shapeless; however, the slip is fitted and well above the knee. since the overdress is sheer, the shortness of the slip is visible the fabric of the overdress felt rough on my skin. i did like the contrast of textures between the overdress, the slip, and the lace. finally, as other reviewers have shared, the buttons are not functional, and the v-neck of the overdress is deep.

10057,"I purchased the navy size small and was delighted with the fit. the waist line is perfectly proportioned for a petite. i think this means that the waist line will be high on a woman who needs regular sizing. i like the lining, it adds a substantial look to the dress.",Positive
10058,"I loved these pants the minute i put them on, and was so happy id ordered them. but i wore them only 3 times - and only at dinners with friends, not even for full days - and the seams on both legs ripped open! i think the faux leather just isnt equipped to handle the stretch of fitted leggings. i was super-bummed about this, because these pants are so insanely cute. but if they cant hold up to a few casual wears, then theres just no way... thankfully retailer was true to their brilliant custom",Negative
10059,"Very beautiful sheath dress that will be perfect for summer weddings and spring events because of the delicious sorbet pallette.  its a substantial weight fabric that will nip you in and give the illusion of curves where none exist (in a good way.).  pattern is actually knit into the fabric not printed.  size 8p is the smaller of my size range so for others who are slender on top may want to size down.  if you have prominent hips, stay tts or size up.  if you are very busty, its tts or size up",Positive

10078,"This is the perfect tank. its super soft, great colors and with a shape that allows you to wear a regular bra. best of all, it was offered in petitie sizes. for me that means i finally have a tank that doesnt gap at the arms or scoop too low or flood me with excess length. thank you retailer for remembering us petitie girls with this wonderful tank!",Positive
10079,These tanks are very soft. i have two black and one coral. i had to return the white as it was see through. they do shrink in the wash even without drying all the way and on low heat so maybe size up if youre in between sizes. i recommend these tanks for sure,Positive

it runs really big
its short and boxy, not at all like it appears on the model, this must be pinned a lot in this picture.

10304,I cant believe how small these are. i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly. these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them. the rise in the crotch is also very short. very full in the legs and one is longer than the other:( the stripes dont line up in places which is also disappointing for this price!,Negative

10322,"I had mixed feelings about this dress. the material is lovely but the skirt is really odd. it has two slips, one that fits close and a second thats a bit too puffy. so the skirt didnt sit well and i thought it made my hips look bigger. the odd length made it unflattering. it might be nicer without the puffy slip but i didnt want to risk it.",Negative

the design however is terrible. when i put them on i double checked to make sure they werent on backwards- the back is flat as a board but the front has these poofy pockets. the poor fit with the bright stripes gives a 1920s circus diaper look which is not good. 

theyre also really tight compar",Negative

10357,I just wore these for the first time and they are so comfortable. the mid rise waist is not too tight as many jeans are on me and the fitted hips keeps the wide leg crop cut from being frumpy. i wore them with sandals and i think they will wear well with booties and boots as the weather gets cooler too. they are a substantial weight jean not just for summer. these jeans will be seeing a lot of wear.,Positive
10358,"I stopped into a store near me specifically to try these on given how adorable they look here. while i liked them, i didnt love them. i love some stretch, so that part was good. however, the denim was much thinner and lighter colored than they look to me online here.

10842,"I saw this dress at my local retailer and passed it the first time. one week later, i stopped by and skimmed through the store and went back to the dress...and decided to try it on. boy oh boy! i grabbed a small and a medium (i usually wear a medium) and the small fit perfectly! the fabric is thick and feels so soft and nice. i love the pockets! worth the splurge and like the other reviewer said- its not maternity like at all. i plan to wear it with brown boots or brown heels.",Positive
10844,"Well...this is on me as i saw this hanging in the store, but way off on my size which is xxs petite.

i looked too quickly and got a nice sa to order it for me.

both pieces are transparent - no opaque lining at all is inside. both pieces are made of fragile clingy materials. there is no flow, just cling. the size is much too big so the resulting look is of two bad pieces hanging oddly without any real shape.

this may be the first time i really just not recommend a piece - at all. bes",Negative
10848,"This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however, like a previous reviewer, the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you cant see in the photos due to the models cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted, without all the excess fabric at the bottom, it would have been perfect. again, the color, the lace, the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came",Negative
10851,"I am a large in knit tees. this is the first tee where the large was just too big. it kind of hung on me. the band across the back also hung down so all over it looked like it was just too big a size for me. the army green turned out to be not a flattering shade of green for me so i returned it. i liked the whole design a lot, especially the front macrame part, but for me it did not work at all. also, too expensive for a tee.",Negative
10853,"Is this dress ever flattering! i have seen many variations of this kind of dress-some where they will kris-cross over the breast area, some where they will have a single twist-but i never have seen one like this with a double twist and oh, what a difference it makes. i particularly love this in blue-which was a very bright royal color in-store. i am not very chesty, so the accenting in that area is very flattering on me and made me fall in love.",Positive
10855,"This top was fun. casual with flair. it is a little strange that it is see through down to the stomach almost, but i would just wear a bra of the same color and dont think anyone would notice.  i didnt buy because even the sale price is too much for a casual tee, in my opinion.",Positive

10863,Super cute and simple shirt (as other reviewer said lol). but she was right! i have another shirt from this brand and its one of my favorites. it runs true to size. its a nice casual wear with jeans kind of shirt and great for fall. it may be a little short for someone with a long torso and/or tall as im only 52 and i wouldnt want it to be any shorter.,Positive
10869,"Just bought this cardigan today. im already a fan of left of center and was happy with this piece. its soft, has more interest to it than your average cardi. the sleeves are a bit long, but its not a dealbreaker. i imagine it will be a great transitional piece from summer to fall and then for spring time.",Positive

11112,"I love almost all tops from retailer, however this one was just enormous. it is beautifully designed, but it was so huge when i tried it on that i couldnt believe it was sized 0. i even checked the tag to see if maybe they placed a size 0 tag on an xl shirt. for reference, i am 52 and 110lbs. i would have loved this shirt if it hadnt been so big.",Negative
11113,"I opened these when i got them yesterday and immediately tried them on. the knees were totally stretched out and due to the panel at the knee, it looked like i had growths popping out between my legs at my knees. someone had received these before me and sent them back after they tried them on or wore them then returned them. they were obviously too small for whoever did that. these never should have been resent to another customer. they are obviously very misshapen. they are going back. on a bet",Negative
11115,"For an athro top, this is a good price point, especially for such a beautiful piece. its really just a basic tee, but the lace insets bring it up several notches. and its much prettier than the picture shows. i think it fits very true to size -- im normally a size small and got that size with this (34d, 124 lbs., 54, 36-26-35.). although the lace is very sheer, i really couldnt see my nude bra through it, so dont feel ill need a cami, because that would ruin the delicate design of this.",Positive

11168,"I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this product. as soon as i put this tunic, the right tie loop detached from the garment. i could return it but the point of shopping online was to avoid the hassle of going to the store. the price of the item does not justify the low quality of the final product.",Negative
11169,"This is such a pretty top. i do not feel it runs big, as another review mentioned. to fit the sleeves comfortably (i do not have large arms at all) i did choose to take a small over my usual xs so the body is a bit llonger than shown on the model (a bit more of a tunic fit on me). it is really a pretty top either way, the xs fitting like it does in the picture on the model and the s fitting a bit longer. worried just a bit that it might develop holes as some tissue tees do.",Positive

11201,The shirt fits true to size. the length of the top is great: not too short (wont show your midrift when you raise your arms) not too long (this is a shirt not a dress). this is a great top for a casual day in jeans or a flirty day with skirt to dress it up.,Positive
11204,I saw this jacket in the store and thought it was really cute..and finally a nice length!! ordered the xl because l and was afraid of shrinkage and it is no larger than the l. runs at least a size small with not alot of give. i will unfortunately have to bring it back.,Negative

11297,This is a beautiful dress but unfortunately it is only for women who are not well endowed - it is extremely well fitted in the chest. the high waste also poufs out due to a lot of extra material and the double lining. a beautiful dress but a very very poor construction. also there are bright blue and yellow beads in the chest area that are a bizarre combo to the corals and browns of the fabric. i am normally a 4/6 at retailer and the 8 was extremely small.,Negative

cons: the fabric is stiffer than i was expecting, and the blouse cuts in under the arms.

12826,This is my first pure+good piece. i am not disappointed. i am 125# and a 34c....ordered the small. fits like a dream. love the moss color. nice long sleeves (i will am picky about sleeves). comfortable fabric. the detail at the cuff is lovely. i can see this versatile piece taking me through the entire year.,Positive
12828,"Love this blazer! combines a chic, pulled together look with super soft, comfortable material. will be great for the office and the weekend. runs a little big?am typically a large or xl, so i ordered the xl and had to exchange for a large. might have actually been able to size down to a medium, but didnt want to deal with the back and forth again.",Positive
12831,Great colors and not too voluminous. lined whig will be great for fall but the downsides are the huge elastic waist bc itll require a belt or something over it (looks v casual alone) and even with a perfect fit it gives a bit of muffin just bc its a huge piece of elastic. ive literally tried this on on two occasions trying to convince myself it it. lol but its not worth it at the current price.,Negative

12839,"Love these charlies! the side zip is a nice change of pace and the dark grey goes with practically everything i own. fabric is a perfect weight for spring and summer too. i ordered one size up, mainly because i put on a couple pounds this past winter (like usual) and the description said slim fit. i went from a 6 to an 8 and the 8s werent big at all, so they might run a tad on the small side. side zipper is a little harder to zip near the waistband, but i dont think that can be prevented.",Positive

12854,"These were so perfect for the first hour or so. i was convinced they were my new favorite pants! but their initial forgiveness turned into a slovenly stretch, and they creased and wrinkled like crazy after id been sitting a couple hours. it looked downright embarrassing - saggy and wrinkly (radiating from the crotch, no less) . i got them in the gray, and its possible that other colors use different, less awful fabric.",Negative
12874,"This top was a disappointment for me. it was beautiful but because of the material it is made out of, it will stretch out as you wear it and not regain its shape. it is also a little heavy for day time during summers in the south.... but the weight of it was not so much of a concern as the ability to retain its shape.",Negative

12888,"When i saw this blouse online i thought it looked like a great combination of casual with the elegance of an intricate print. i was so disappointed when it came. the print is not centered in the front or the back. it looks like they were trying to save on the material and just cut it out wherever with no thought to symmetry. for this price the detail of centering the design was expected, especially because this is how it appeared in the picture. loved the blouse, but i will be returning it becau",Negative

12896,This is a delightfully soft and fluffy sweater. i might have bought it if my store had the petite size. the white was pretty and a good weight (not too light or heavy) and comfortable. it would be fun to layer over various outfits. it did not seem to shed.,Positive

12934,"The saundra tank is a very pretty and feminine knitted top. it is soft and comes in a very delicate pink color.
i took this on a recent trip and it paired well with capri tights and wedges. it was very comfortable to wear having a medium weight to it. the only issue that i had was that the cut below your arms is very deep and made it difficult to hide the side of your bra. it is a rather loose fit, so if you prefer something more form fitting, you might opt for a smaller size.",Positive

13108,"So these look so good online - i love flare and the button detail. however, on me, they were very long (which i knew) but too thigh-hugging for my taste, and the buttons looked cheap (i ordered the tan color). thus, back they went. for reference, i am 55 and 125# and ordered the 6.",Negative

13124,This fit me perfectly with a little room but think its meant to be this way so easier to get on and off. this feels like a dream and is very good quality. definitely a heavier piece but i like that. it is so very flattering and drapes beautifully to hide my tummy. the back is adorable too! retailer hit it out of park with this one! grab it before its too late! im a 36ddd and size 14 and the large fit perfectly,Positive
13127,Just a heads up - this is a romper - pants and not a dress! you cant tell from the pictures. i ordered thinking it was a dress but its actually ... culottes? im not sure what you would call it. the pull on styling was awkward and the sash was bulky. it definitely goes back!,Negative

13192,Purchased the petite size of these jeans and the length is perfect for my 53 height. the description doesnt mention what length the petite size is but i believe it to be 31 inches. the jean is cut small in the hips and snug in the thighs so consider going up a size if you are curvy. great color and style. i may be 60 something but these jeans bring me back to my youth. love them.,Positive

i also like that the width of the sweater is an alternative to everything thats cut so tightly fitted - its a nice width, with some room, without being boxy.",Positive

13386,This is baby soft and a great basic. i ordered my normal size large and it clings in an unattractive way so you might want to size up for a better fit if youre not going to wear it as a layer. the black color is saturated in a good way. its also very long but im short so this would be perfect for taller frames.,Positive
13390,Great sweater. cozy and thick. the bands at the waist and wrists help keep this sweater in place. the loopy knitted fabric adds a bit of texture to the gray which makes it a little more exciting than your average gray sweater. i got a small and it fit perfectly.,Positive

13418,"Ive had my eye on this cute knit top for awhile and when there was a sale, i picked up both colors. they fit me like they do the model, a little loose and swingy, but not overly so. the colors look spot-on like the picture. i am rather top heavy, (34dd) but with the colors being darker on the top portion, i feel like this works without accentuating my bust too much. i am 54 and weigh 149, the medium worked out great. the knit is soft and it appears to be made well. the only drawback is a rough",Positive

13546,"I grabbed my typical size (8) and found it fit snug in the bust. the fabric has plenty of stretch, so the snugness was fine, especially because it meant there was no gaping along the neckline in the front. its lowcut, but i didnt feel particularly exposed. i ended up not buying it because i dont think it fit my body right. the distance between the top of the shoulder and the bottom of the arm hole was too long for me - a significant portion of my bra was exposed at the bottom of the arm hole",Negative
13550,"I love the concept of an airy, flowing sweater that has great detail. this item stole my heart online. however, i am fairly petite (53) and it looked like it was drowning me. the neck line is decently wide and my small frame couldnt hold it up; it kept falling off my shoulders. i ended up returning. i think it would look and feel fantastic though if i were taller and had broad shoulders.",Negative

13566,This is a sweet top as it is shown. on the model it appears there is a panel behind the lace on the front of the top. this is not so-the entire front of the top is see through. one would need to wear a camisole. the material on the blouse is very sheer-it appears to be rather cheap actually. if you are wearing a top this sheer it does not make sense to have a camisole on underneath. that said you are going to be able to see your bra and skin down to your belly button if you do not have a camisol,Negative

14594,I agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that didnt require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness. i mean for the price shouldnt it be lined or something. when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low. but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i cant really complain too much. plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off. i gave up at that,Negative
14599,"This dress didnt work for me at all. im 6ft tall, 160lb, i usually wear size l 8/10, but based on the reviews i ordered an m. the material of this dress is very soft and fuzzy, color is about the same as pictured, also length is appropriate. dress is very thick and warm, the fabric however has no stretch at all, dress is very specious and shapeless. there is allot of room everywhere except shoulders & sleeves, i thought that area was tight & snug which is strange because it runs large everywhe",Negative
14602,Loved the pattern and colors of this dress. the material was extremely heavy. the shoulders and across the back was very small so that i couldnt lift my arms or put them out straight in front of me. but then the rest of the dress was huge and shapeless. sadly i had to return it.,Negative

back it goes. super cute but huge.",Negative
14605,"I love this blouse!! the shape is very flattering. the fabric is sheer, perfect for those hot summer days. i especially like the way the sleeves fall, just enough flounce. the buttons are a great detail. i didnt bother undoing them, just threw it over my head. looks great dressed up or down.",Positive
14607,"Very pretty color (slightly darker than on my computer), a bit like a light periwinkle/lavender... embroidery is lovely and the dress has a fresh spring-like quality. the style is a basic shift, but the color and details make up for the straight shape. great dress for the spring/summer months. good quality and was a nice deal on sale!",Positive
14608,Way too big and had a granny like styling. was very excited but ultimately took it back.,Negative
14611,I have this top in both the green and blue and live them both. the back of this top is so cute and makes the whole top.the embroidery  is cute too.,Positive

14618,"I saw this at my retailer store and hesitated to try it on as it looked so long. im only 51, so it goes to above my ankles. its like a midi dress on me, but i really love it! it is so flattering. there is a inner lining that smoothes out anything you dont want to show. its the usual bailey 44 great quality. so slimming! hugs the booty in the right way! definitely worth the money!",Positive
14620,"This top is absolutely beautiful. the fabric is great, the cut is nice, etc... however, the buttons are too big for the button loops, which do not have any stretch. it took ten minutes to open the shirt to try it on. once i had it on, i left it unbuttoned. i returned it. (if you cant live without it, you could put smaller buttons on it.) too pricey for a non-functioning top. too bad.",Negative
14630,A serious joke. i struggled with the buttons for a good 10 minutes and gave up after the 3rd button. im not sure what they were thinking.,Negative
14633,I absolutely love this dress! it hugs your body without being clingy - very flattering. the fabric is so soft. i am 57 - 120 lbs - and i usually take an xs or s - i got a m in this dress because of the style and fit and it was perfect.,Positive
14638,"I am absolutely shocked that so many people love this dress. maybe i should have sized up and reconsidered, but i still dont think it would have worked. the fabric is very soft but thats where its qualities, for me, ended. the knot felt huge to me and definitely added unnecessary size to my already curvy hips. (for reference im 54 and 125, hourglass. 32dd .) the cut at the bottom also felt very strange and restrictive to me, like i would have had to take smaller steps to walk around in it.",Negative
14639,"I purchased the washed-out blue color. it is lovely with blue or black jeans. medium fit great. it is heavier cotton, and ever so slightly stretchy. this is not the kind of cotton to eventually come out of the dryer with tiny holes around the bottom of the tee. it is very comfortable. the embellishment on the sleeves is a nice touch, and i like the yoke with loop closure on the back. a fun addition to my casual wardrobe.",Positive
14640,"I had a few pairs of these high-waisted beauties last year and love them so i was thrilled to see them in this adorable pattern which is even cuter in person. unfortunately, the cut is different. the sides, covered here by the models hands, flare out a bit which is the function of the sectioning that the piping accentuates. the top is not the definitively high-wasted height from last year. i dont own anything else high-wasted, being an apple im generally a low-rider owing to a small hips/butt",Negative

14645,This looked nothing like the picture on me. was long and very unflattering. belled out greatly at the bottom also. the material was thick which is why i give it three starts for quality. but overall awkward.,Negative

14659,"I was lucky enough to hit retailer day in san diego and snagged this little number - it is truly better looking in person. the dress hugs in all the right places and actually fits tighter than the model shows, but the material is that soft, but stretchy and gently molds to the shape of your body. i was really surprised, i would have never tried this dress from the photo shown. so glad i went in - its really adorable!",Positive
14660,"This is a very fitted dress. i love it and it is very comfortable but might only be appropriate for date night as it really hugs curves. there is a lining of the same material underneath that holds you in a little. i think it could go with a lot of different shoes and you could dress it up or down with jewelry, jacket, even a large sweater over the top. tts. i definitely would not recommend sizing down! im a 8/10 and the med is right for me.",Positive
14663,"I love wearing this so much! i wear it with leggings, jeans and i also like to pair it with is a long linen skirt that i have. i purchased it in plum and then went back for a second in moss. i got them before they went on sale for fear theyd be out of my size. i am very happy with my purchase! i highly recommend.",Positive

14667,This tee has a loose fit. very comfortable. covers my backside with inches to spare. flattering fit although oversized. im a small-medium in most retailer tops. the small fit me nicely. 34dd 140lbs 56. bought it in olive and mustard. great for layering or weekends.,Positive

14672,"I love the cut of this top, it flares out nicely, and is very stylish. the blue is also soft on every skin tone! even my super pale skin :-) i like that it has some detail, not just the plain chambray/denim color. the xs was nice, i didnt try petite or xxs, just bought the xs in store... you can adjust how tight the fit is by tying the top and loose is nice in this style. the length was also good. (115 lbs, 30dd chest)",Positive
14677,"Although i love retailer, this product isnt the quality or presentation i expect from them. the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess. the fabric wasnt soft and fluid as i expected, but rather was stiff and a little scratchy. i purchased the ecru version, which was also slightly darker than the photo showed. i returned the dress and will keep looking.",Negative
14678,"Im thrilled with this purchase, and looking forward to spending many years with this classic. on the subject of fit; i generally wear size medium for tops, but my broad shoulders occasionally have me in larges. since the thick-textured fabric is mostly cotton and minimal stretch (with a mix of linen), the larger size will provide more room and comfort. im honoring my tts choice for folks who prefer a more fitted look. overall this piece wears well!!",Positive

my only complaint. i wish it had pockets.",Positive
14692,I bought this top on sale in the store and immediately came home and ordered it in another color online. i love the length even in the xs which isnt always the case. i am 59 and a size 2 and the xs fits me perfect even after washing and drying a couple times. looks cute under sweaters and vests. can wear all year round. lightweight and good neckline.,Positive
14693,"I bought the first one in the gold color, which i call mustard. i really love the high-low style and looks great when worn with a long necklace(s). when they went on sale, i bought two more, black and grey. i love that they are perfect for layering when its cold, but that i can also wear them alone, in other seasons. thy ran a bit large for me, so i was able to purchase the small. i am small boned, but large in the bust. im also short, 52, but they dont look too long, especially when i wear",Positive
14696,"I purchased the green dress in medium. i usually wear a medium. the fabric is pretty. shoulders fit nicely. sleeves were short in an odd length, but that is indeed pictured accurately. the body of the dress is very shapeless, billowy and wide, which made this appear far more like a nightgown than the photo shown. i considered altering the garment, by sewing in the sides from the armpit downward, but i decided to return the dress.",Negative

14704,This whole order was disappointing. the main piece i ordered was cancelled and the two remaining items - this sweater included were poorly made. there was a snag/thread hanging out in the middle of the front of the sweater - tried to tuck it in but it wouldnt stay so ill be returning it.,Negative
14706,This sweater is thick and does cover the bra well. i did not find it to be well made. the ribbing seemed to be attached loosely in places. i am a size large with a b cup and a bit thicker through the middle to my middle age dismay. putting this sweater on in coral made me feel like a giant peach. for those with larger breasts it is likely more flattering.,Negative
14707,"It seems like most people love this tee, so you might as well. i returned it because i didnt like how the front hung. if the front was as long as the back, i would have kept it. or, if the front was short enough to wear with thick pants, untucked, i might have kept it (seems like this top would only look good with leggings or skirts). i do like the material, though. its very thin and looks great in the shoulder and neck area. and i liked how the back of the shirt looked when i tried wearing it",Negative

14718,"I saw this dress online and immediately fell in love with the bow design. purchased my typical size 4 but found it way too tight. i went to my local retailer to exchange it for the size 6. unfortunately, even the size 6 just did not fit right. moving around in the dress was challenging; the slightest shoulder/arm movement made the dress ride up. i was constantly pulling it down. the fabric is also quite stiff and heavy. overall, its a cute dress but just not for me.",Negative
14719,"Bought this dress online in my usual 0p for a special event and liked the cut but found the area around my stomach and the bottom of the open area on the back to be a bit large. this in the back created the potential problem of flapping open so that you could see down the back of the dress. surprisingly they had 00p as well so i reordered that one and love it.

14722,"I love the classy design and the little surprise bow in the back. i am 52 and about 107lbs, size 0 fit well. i was afraid it might be too short, but on me it is just above the knee. the bow on the back did not hide the bra strap on me, but the fabric is thick overall so that it can be worn without one. the fit is great once on, but it is a little hard to take off, since the zipper is not on the side so there is no relief in the arm/chest area. the color is beautiful, its true to the pictures.",Positive
14725,"I purchased the dress with the bow-back shift in peach because i loved its nautical theme pattern.  when i recurve do the dress, i found it to be stiff and boxy.  being a petite, short-waisted person, the top portion of the stress hung on my body awkwardly.  my bra strap was showing in the back, and the dress needed to be pulled up about 2 inches to properly sit on my frame.

unfortunately i have to agree with other reviewers, the pockets and the positing of the draw string made my hips look unflatteringly large. i tried on a size 0 petite, which is my usual size. all flowed nicely except for when you get to the pockets. truly disappointed as it was beautiful in every other way. but in the end, i had to pass.",Negative

14941,"I bought this top on a whim - its not 100% my style, but wanted to try something different. the fabric and print are amazing! so unique, soft, subtle, and delicate. great fit as well. my only complaint is not the fault of the top, but if you have a bit of tummy, the fold at the peplum really brings it out so youd have to wear high-waisted bottoms or suck it in. the hem is also really flowy, more so than shown in the pictures. theres a lot of fabric so it kind of ruffles more at the bottom rath",Positive
14942,Tops are a challenge for me. i am top heavy so i often have to size up to avoid pulling in the bust. this one is not over sized in the bust but i am able to open the laceing for a little more wiggle room but still not look like i am wearing a tent. fabric is wonderful. it is not too thin and not too thick.? it does pull up slightly in the wash. it requires a little ironing or a good steaming.,Positive
14945,"An odd top.
for my curvy figure (34g), the seam did not enhance, but rather made me look wider.

15095,"Did not work for me. whatsoever. the stripes were adorable but the piece just didnt fit like on the model. the collar was practically choking me and the tie just didnt make my figure look the way it normally does. aka i looked frumpy and chunky, which im not. going back.",Negative
15097,So this may be my least favorite thing i have ever bought from retailer. this top had so much extra material it was like wearing a bag or parachute. it looked a million times cuter in the photos.,Negative
15101,Every so often the perfect pair of bottoms comes along. this style was it for me. im tall 59 so the length fits perfect for a crop wide leg trouser. i will be able to wear these in the summer as they are light weight enough and also into fall before it gets too cold. cant wait to wear them. extra bonus i got them on sale. if you are short these will probably be more like a long leg trouser on you. also fit true to size.,Positive
15102,"Cant say enough about these pants.
i often find leggings to be to revealing when wearing them with long but not long enough top. i have a longer torso so finding tops that hit this sweet spot is an issue for me. i also dont love long flowy tops with jeans all the time. the portions look all off and i look and feel heavy in my middle section.

15108,I love white blouses in the summer. this one is perfect. bought one size down and it is perfect. the lovely tailored neck is very flattering and hard to find. i do send it to the cleaners just to make sure it keeps that crisp cool look for hot summer days.,Positive
15112,Ordered in my normal size large and i love it. beautiful fit. striking pattern thats quite slimming. the stripes are deep chocolate next to a mauve purple gray on a white background. it looks black so lots of colors would work on top. the fabrication is a soft rib knit and it has a substantial elastic waistband. it overlaps in the front and the opening falls a bit  high so that may be a deal breaker for some because it does expose some upper thigh. i like the look but im 53 so it works well,Positive

cool watch pocket), the size of the buttons, the color. i got the honey,
and it was lovely and intense,. now, the bad:
i got the regular 8. the jacket is at least an inch too short. although its
a small, tight 8, the sleeves are strikingly too long. they would have to
be folded, and the lining which would show is not that attractive.",Negative
15182,"This blazer is a nice weight for summer. it is more terracotta than rose, but is still a nice color. the fit is tts and flattering. however, the buttons were almost falling off the one i received. i didnt take this as a sign of great quality and plan to return it.",Negative
15184,"This sweater is beautiful, especially in the bordeaux color. the cable knit in varying directions makes it interesting and unique and the length is great for us short waisted ladies. my big issue with this sweater is the sleeves. there really are no sleeves, just arm holes at the same level as the hem of the sweater, so you feel as if you need to keep your arms pinned to your sides to keep from lifting the sweater up to expose your midsection, or pushing the sleeves way up, which then results in",Negative

15424,"I typically wear a 4/6 but am a little bigger right now, so i went with the medium. was so excited to get these but was very disappointed when i tried them on. they look beautiful, but there is no lining, leaving the fabric uncomfortable. they were also huge! definitely make sure you size down if you d",Negative
15432,"I love this dress! the colors work well with my olive skin color, it has pockets and it has a hi-lo front/back.Ã¢Â Ã¢Â i have slim hips so the tie waist is very flattering which gives an hourglass figure.Ã¢Â Ã¢Â i am 5?2?, 116 lbs and a 32d.Ã¢Â Ã¢Â i usually need a petite size because retailer dresses run a little long on me. but i was able to get away with getting an xs regular because of the hi-lo length. it fell perfectly above my knee.",Positive

it is very high waisted, and at 58 the length was similar to the model.",Positive

finally returned it without it making it out the door :(",Negative
15448,"I have blazers in size 8 from this designer and they fit with room to spare. i understand this is a more fitted style, but it is still way too small. size 10 and size 12 were not much bigger. great colors and cute design, but just too small even if you do not plan on buttoning it. i hope they bring back this jacket but make it true to size.",Negative
15449,I was so afraid to get a too-small blazer (based on other reviews) that i ordered this two sizes up. i am usually a 0 or 2 in a blazer and ordered a 4. it was huge. i then ordered a 2 and it is just right. its comfortable and chic and i love the blue and black combination.,Positive
15455,"This design looks really sharp on the image, but in reality this jacket felt more like a jacket you would get at forever xxi.  the fabric had that polyester/shiny quality to it that made it look cheap.  since the fabric was pretty soft, with a gray jersey lining, it felt more like a padded jacket than a constructed blazer.  

i also thought the cut was small if you have a bust larger than a b, i felt like i was busting out of a size 8, and i am a 34d.",Negative
15458,"I was not in the market for a black blazer but saw this in store and had to try it on. the quality of the fabric and overall aesthetic is fantastic! love love love the gold buttons. this will look great for work, with jeans, or even as a cover up over a cute dress. i am a generally a size medium (sometimes small) and tend to fall between a 6 and 8, i went with the 8 in this jacket!",Positive

15467,I purchased this jacket in my local store. size 10 and runs really small . i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality. i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling. looks like it is worn in an bad way. returned the next day. this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad.,Negative
15470,"True, this blazer runs small, so size up! beyond the beautiful depth of color from the herringbone black and dark blue, the stretchy fabric allows for flexibility in what you can wear underneath and for both your bloated and your skinny days. best of all this blazer could be worn 3-4 seasons out if the year and its got a super-soft lining.",Positive
15471,I want to like and keep. at this price point i cant justify keeping. if it does go to clearance i will reorder. due to the thin material it seems more summery and casual than what i was anticipating. true to size. i ordered a medium and am 59 and 155 pounds.,Negative

15509,"Its a cute idea, but its so low cut and the material is very thin. i was hoping to wear it as a cool, flowing summer top, but ill have to layer it since my whole bra basically hangs out of it. im only keeping it because it was such a good price. also the buttons are super tiny and a little hard to fasten.",Negative

15535,"What a cute top! i would say true to size. it is a pullover so i went with a 6, for easy dressing. the scalloped tank around the shoulders is unique and lays nicely. i would say the top is a lined in cut. not too swingy at all. a great length to be left out or tucked in. i can think of so many uses for this top, i may grab another to keep on hand. will be adorable with skirts or shorts.",Positive
15537,"I love a crisp white poplin blouse and this top is perfect in that role. i am between a small and medium in retailer tops. because this top looked a little bell in the model photos, i decided to order a 6. it was a bit snug across the chest. for reference, i am a 34c. i returned it for the 8 and it fit perfect. im not sure why this top was offered during the winter because it will likely hang in my closet until april. highly recommend this blouse for summer.",Positive
15538,"While the styling is cute, the fit was poor under the arms and there was quite a gap. i returned this.",Negative
15542,"I normally wear a medium with these types of fabrics but this one was oddly proportioned on me. the skirt was also not very flattering to my hourglass figure, but it at least fit well. the top was baggy and gaped at the armpits as stated by others. i really wanted to like this dress but it made me look 20 pounds heavier even in the places it looked too big on me. i could have tried going with a small but the skirt would have then been too short.",Negative

15546,"This top is very soft and well made. for my short and curvy figure, it is very unflattering. i considered altering it, but there is no way to do it. it gapes in the front and if you have a waist at all, it wont show because this top is boxy and full in that area. if you are tall and slim, it might be perfect, so give it a try.",Negative

15549,"So, this dress is extremely comfortable, but its just really awkward. i am on the fence about keeping it, my husband loves it and thinks i should. it just draws attention to the belly, so any issues after having kids, is very noticeable. not to mention the huge cutouts for the arms. very comfortable, but not sure if i will keep it.",Negative
15555,"I wanted to love this top! on me it was weirdly boxy. it was too wide and too short, and it was more sheer than i expected it. the fabric is lightweight but wrinkles really easy and loses shape pretty quickly. i also thought the fabric would be heavier and have more structure than it has. i love the scalloped detail at the arms but after about five minutes of wear this felt super crumpled and just kind of sloppy. unfortunately it will be going back.",Negative
15560,"I purchased the dusty rose. i thought the picture represented the color accurately. the shirt material had a nice thickness and drape. it felt very luxurious. the opening in the front is cut a little low but workable.

15565,"The sweater runs large, the sweater is designed in such a way that it looks very sloppy. i would never be able to wear it out of the house. however, the material is exceptionally soft and delightful. keeping as its a great stay at home & lounge sweater, but way over priced for this purpose. if you can get the fabric to lay correctly, youre a genius.",Negative

i havent yet worn it and hope that it does stay off the shoulder, as pictured, without having to constantly re-arrange.
great sale price!",Positive
15567,"I loved the cut and the stretch in the material made them comfortable, however i found that the material was unflattering for thicker thighs because it tended to cling to the body. it would have been better with some sort of lining as it would have prevented the flimsy material from highlighting imperfections. bottom of pants are not hemmed, so if you want a clean look, you may not like the edges. these were returned immediately as it just did not work for me.",Negative
15568,I wanted to like this sporty dress too. i teach at an elementary school and like to get down on my knees st my students level - plus we can get messy most days with our learning and most days are go - go - go being on every second...the armholes were cut too big and weirdly squared. i didnt like the middle ridge either as it was unflattering. it was returned.,Negative

15590,"I am always on the hunt for a white shirt that is not too sheer, so that i can wear it without a cami underneath. on that count, this top is a winner!
regarding the fit, it is a shorter top, so i am not sure that it would be able to be tucked in a bottom for most people. i am short waisted, and i wouldnt be able to tuck it in.
in fact, i think it is really meant to have an almost cropped fit.

15619,This is the most fabulous sweater ever. i really hesitated spending $368 for a sweater but this sweater is worth every dime! it is soft and luxurious. i tried it over a cashmere cable knit dress and it looks unbelievable -- i also tried it over jeans and it looks equally as good. if it came in another color - id buy it too.,Positive

15630,"I was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired. it fits tts, length is fine...the inside is some, but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap (kinda canvas feeling?). the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way. it also is on the thinnish side - it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm. this is definitely going back.",Negative
15632,"This sweater vest is the best! it is so versatile! ive already worn it over a dress and recieved compliments all day. the knit is substantial without being to thin or heavy. i love the little flecks of color in the yarn as well! it makes coordinating easy. i thought the faux fur might be too overwhelming or hot, but thankfully its not at all. runs true to size. worth full price!",Positive

15702,The green color was beautiful but the top was too low cut and looked more maternity than boho.,Negative
15703,"This dress is adorable. thanks to everyone who commented that the dress runs small as thats definitely true. i ended up ordering up two sizes and got a perfect fit. i was afraid the wrapped skirt might emphasize the hips too much, but that isnt the case. it adds a bit of quirky style and makes this different from the usual shirt dress. its great with booties or chunky wedges.",Positive
15708,I ordered this in xsp navy with the merlot/burgundy flower and it fits above the knees as pictured. the tunic is medium weigh and has a-line shape with a loose waist and i find it very comfortable. the sleeve are straight cut (not tight) and 3/4 quarter in length. i will wear it with leggings and boots/booties this coming fall.. i find this tunic is well-made and disagreed with one review that it is cheaply made.

15711,I do not have an retailer where i live so i ordered this tunic online. the material is extremely soft & comfortable ( not at all itchy). tts. i fell in love with it immediately and cant believe how many compliments i received all day long when i wore it to work ( with some skinny ankle length pants). can be dressed up or down. this is certainly going to get a lot of use this fall,Positive

15726,I love the look of this dress and the material - the problem is that when i tried it on the fit was a bit off. it seems that the arm holes hung down way too much and pulled the dress so it is uncomfortable to wear. i dont think i could have gone down or up a size to make this dress work. it is a shame because i really liked the look of it.,Negative
15730,"Bought this shirt on sale. it was super cute in the dressing room, and for the first time i wore it. washed it per the instructions (wash delicate with cold water, lay flat to dry) and it shrunk so much i dont think im going to be able to wear it anymore. it was oversized and loose when i bought it, so it shrunk a lot. there is also a small hole all of the sudden, that i have no idea where it came from (wasnt there when i put it in the washer). very disappointed.",Negative
15731,"This is the cutest sweater. i bought it today in black. i cannot wait to wear it. it is a lovely, distinctive knit & just the right weight to layer as shown with a white blouse or with a turtleneck. i tried both the xs and s; and i decided to go with the s as it still emphasized that i have waist, but i could layer it nicely. i am 54, 130 lb. you can always count on angel of the north for great style.",Negative

15760,"First, the product arrived in a very small bag that made for many, many wrinkles - almost impossible to determine what it might look like. shame on retailer for sending their items in this manner. secondly, i dont know how individuals wear this with a bra. the back is cut so low that my bra back band partially showed - not my idea of a good look. third, the front necessitated a cami, and there is no way a cami can be worn due to how it is cut in the back. returning now, and i just received it.",Negative
15779,This shirt was very cute. i ordered it as something to be able to wear to class with leggings and it is perfect. the colors are great and the length is very nice. it will be a nice piece to layer with a jacket for the the fall.,Positive

15788,Beautiful design and perfect for warm days. it has a lovely open back with the perfect amount of loose fitting flow.,Positive
15789,"I loved everything about this dress. the fit, the style and the ability to wear in the fall. i wore it once, washed it in gentle/hand-wash cycle, in cold water and laid it out flat to dry- per the instructions- and it shrank at least a full size. its going back. i am so sad, as i said earlier, i really loved this dress.",Negative

15793,"When i tried it on, it was a bit shapeless, but it was on a promo so i decided to get it. i kind off like shapeless. ive worn it three times and washed it gently in the machine as recommended (in a lingerie bag, always) and air dried it. it now has a huge rip on the sleeve seam, and i cannot see how this happened. the inner lining is soft and substantial  but the outer gauze layer is thin.",Negative
15794,"I love the photo of this and because the reviews were so positive i ordered it. i was shocked when i opened the package. first, the fabric is not the silky rayon cotton blend i was expecting. it looks and feels more like a cheap cotton. it does not have the drape or feel or look i expect in a kimono, which brings me to the second disappointment. it is not a kimono at all. it has no kimono sleeve, no sleeves at all in fact. just a slit in the side of the body of the garment you put your arm throu",Negative

15827,"I had such high hopes for this dress, but unfortunately it misses the mark completely. the design is flawed in that you cannot raise your arms to shoulder length. for someone who is 53, 105lbs, the dress has no shape and looks like something from zoolanders derelict campaign. i think one must have a specific body type for this dress, but regardless, theyll have to keep their arms at their sides.",Negative
15829,"I couldnt wait to get this dress! i bought it and was instantly disappointed when i took it out of the bag. while the fabric was beautiful, the sizing was way off. this dress claims to be 35 long, and i could tell instantly it wasnt. it barely covered my rear. i also know its supposed to be flowy, but it was really, really wide. i can see this working for someone around 5 feet tall who is wider.",Negative
15835,I am very surprised by the low reviews of this dress. this dress is obviously a very loose fitting style. it is a bit of a man repellar dress.the quality of the fabric is beautiful and the pattern stunning. i find the loose flowy style liberating and comfortable. i love it with otk boots and tights for winter but also planning to wear with sandals in spring. i am 125lbs and purchased the petite small.,Positive
15840,"This may be lovely on some people but it didnt work on me at all. i thought it would have some swing to it but the bottom hem was tight. if i had gone up a size, the top would have been huge. the bib wasnt flattering on me and its also quite sheer. too bad because the print is great. maybe if youre athletic with slim hips you can manage it. i think if you are busty this could look like maternity wear on you. back it went, sadly.",Negative
15847,I tried this on at the store - the fuzzy trim around the bib is adorable and the overall texture with little puffs woven into the fabric has a nice quality feel to it. the pattern of flamingos is fun and the fabric is soft. it does run on the big and flowy side. i thought it was very cute and comfy but ultimately did not buy it because the price is rather high and the petite length is sold out. ill snap it up if it goes on sale.,Positive
15850,"Pretty top online - okay in person. runs small, especially on bottom hemline. thought it would have a swing to it. it does not. more sheer in person than i thought it would be. that wouldnt stop me from keeping it though. it was the way it laid on my chest that was unflattering. looked like i was wearing a bib. i dont have a large chest, just weird look on me. unfortunate, because it is an adorable print. top made for thinner or a petite lady.",Negative
15853,Never would have thought i would love it so much based on the picture online but saw it in person and its so cute!!  colors are very rich in person - even the soft pink (not a big pink gal) works so well with the other colors.  great quality with full lining.  i lucked out and picked it up for a steal on clearance with another 40% off!  just love it!!,Positive
15857,Very soft color and soft to touch. the material is light and airy and it feels great on. i wear a medium and bought the small. i would definitely buy this in another pattern if they made it as cute as the flamingos.,Positive
15860,"Only worn this once but had multiple compliments! such a cute pattern and style. only complaint is wish they would have done the sides with a split. it kind of wants to hug the hips and then be too wide in the middle. still, love it!",Positive

15866,"I definitely agree with the other reviewers who said this top is better suited for someone tall and slender. the design on the lace is beautiful and i love the scalloped hem. but it is somewhat boxy and flowy, which didnt seem to work on my curvy body proportion-wise.",Positive

15914,These capri length pants are awesome!  i do recommend sizing down though as the l was really big on me (i am a 10-12 with most of my weight in my rear so normally never size down in pants)--the fabric is really nice and the print is versatile and allows wonderfully for pattern mixing.  super comfortable!,Positive

16059,"This top fit me great across the bust - true to size there, however, it was very loose other than that (outside of the peplum of course). it did not seem flattering for my body shape/did not give me much shape on top. i was wider than i should be/am. this may work on some body types, but did not work for me. it was a nice feeling, comfortable top however.",Negative

16069,Super cute. 59 135 lbs and the medium was perfect to wear with a long sleeve shirt underneath. good quality and lined too. perfect for daytime when a leather moto might be a bit much.,Positive
16073,I was thrilled to find a wide-legged pant in a natural fiber and ordered two pairs - l and xl. the l came first and was a tad too close for comfort so i returned it. when the xl arrived it seemed roomy but after my first wear the fold-over jersey knit waistband stretched out and the pants were dragging on the ground. they seem really huge on me and i now have to wear a belt to keep them up. the fabric also seems to be pilling easily- overall not my best retailer purchase (and i am a huge fan,Negative

16097,"I completely agree with the other reviewer. this sweater is so much prettier in person. ive been looking for years for a tasteful fur sweater and i think i finally found it. the size large was true to size for me aside from the very long sleeves, but i also have short arms. the fur isnt overwhelming and i love the pockets. i usually find sweaters with wool itchy but this one is not (its 26% wool). i do plan to wear a cami or tank underneath.",Positive

the dress is a beautiful cocktail of sexy curvy silhouette with the baroque flavor",Positive
16113,"This dress is stunning. the combinations of patterns/fabrics is beautiful and the cut is very flattering. i tend to wear a 6 or 8 depending on brand and the 8 fits perfectly. i am 32c on top and more of an apple than a pear shape, so the straight lines hide the tummy but shape the hips. love love love. i cant wait to wear this.",Positive

17022,"I ordered a large and despite wearing a large in many other items from antrhopologie, this item was too small, especailly across the bust. it was very well-made and the color green is beautiful, but unfortunately, i will not be able to wear it. so disappointed.",Negative
17027,I usually love a cowl neck sweater but not this one. you cant wear it off the shoulders and its weirdly sheer too. the only pro is that it doesnt include wool or fur.,Negative
17034,"I love this sweater. i ordered the xs because i have very narrow hips and i didnt want it to be too baggy. it fits a little like a very short sweater dress on me. what i really love is that the arms are nice and long. one of my pet peeves is sweaters that are compromised in arm length. 
i bought the pink and plan to get at least one other color too!",Positive
17035,"I really loved the look of this dress online and couldnt wait to try it on. based on my measurements i ordered a petite medium, following the petite size chart. the dress was the perfect length for my 55 frame, but it was just way too loose and not flattering on my figure. im 36c-32-37 and i looked like a sack of potatoes in the dress. the fabric and lining feel great though. i just wasnt the right fit for me.",Negative
17036,"The sweater is nice but is very thin. it is see-through which does not make it a good fall/winter item for me. the design & structure of the sweater is nice & looks slimming on which is a bonus. i originally ordered my regular size (s) but had to upgrade to a large in order to get the neck to fall on my shoulder as shown in the picture. this wasnt a problem since the sweater is form fitting so getting the larger size did not make it look too big. overall, i did not keep the seater as i thought",Negative
17040,This dress is a beautiful color and is so lightweight and flowing. will be perfect for a fall wedding that i am attending. it is supposed to be loose so i think it is relatively true to size if not just a bit on the large side. will look great with a kimono or other wrap when the weather is a bit chilly.,Positive
17042,I am so surprised this was not styled properly in the photo! if worn the way it should be worn it would have sold out before going on sale. yes it is open down each side but you need to slide a belt inside the back so the back is left full and bring the belt out into the front on sides cinching in the front...making this a dramaticly gorgeous piece! i love it and will wear it with my leather jeans to pencil skirt. i am a personal stylist and designer and if you are thinking about this piece jump,Positive
17043,"I bought the white in my usual xs size, i dont agree with some of the other reviews that say it is thin, because it is not a sweater. it is a pullover in a kind of waffle weave fabric , not a sweater knit. very cute with a flattering fit. casual wear.",Positive

17053,"I absolutely love slips, and i like the grey tone of this one-and that it is not super shiny. it adds to the versatility of the slip-which i wear many ways. i wear them as under layers for long cardigans, i wear them as a real traditional slip under other dresses, and i also have been known to wear them to bed. the fabric on this one is absolutely comfortable and lightweight. i like that the fabric is cut in a babydoll format and the straps are wider (an a different color) which adds just enough",Positive
17054,"I ordered these pants in my usual size (xl) and was shocked when i received them. the waist was huge and there was nothing in the way of an elastic or tie to keep them up. i couldnt keep them on so, of course, back they go! too bad! the sweater quality is great.",Negative

17059,I saw the colors and texture of this top and wanted to love it however when i put it on it just did not work. the cut was so strange. it runs very small in the shoulders and then flairs out so much at the waist. i even ordered up a size based on reviews. i ordered an 8 when i normally where a small (6) in things. the shoulders were still too small and it was way too big every where else.,Negative

fits tts, i wear a l and that is my normal retailer size. i am tempted to get the cream as well!",Positive
17067,"Love the shape of this top and often look to retailer for corset-style summer tops that are pretty. this top is made from a thick, stiff fabric that doesnt breathe. so my usual size xxs was too constricting. tried an xs also and it basically fit but i still wasnt a fan of the very heavy fabric in a summer top. its almost like a neoprene. the colors are an odd choice and not my favorite either. i wanted to see in person and they just dont cut it for me. would love in different colors and softer",Negative
17074,"These pants are so cute and flattering. the linen is substantial and the quality of the tailoring is very good. i typically wear a 26p, but they were sold out in the gray color, so i tried the 25p and they fit perfectly. this tells me that they run just a little big, at least in the petite sizing. i wish the rose color was available in petite. i am considering ordering the chocolate as well.",Positive

17076,A great addition to any wardrobe. can go with nice trousers and dressier shoes for work or jeans and trainers for a casual look. i didnt find it to run small and indeed thought it fit as id expect.,Positive
17078,"I loved the look of these pants in the pictures online and i loved the way that they fit. however when i got my pair, the flower placement was completely different. the whole front was black and there were just flowers running out of the crotch seams. i ordered another pair hoping they were just cut wrong, but those were even worse. they looked obscene.",Negative

17245,"Way too much fabric; sticks out like jodhpurs but from the hip - eek! might be a great dress in rayon or a drapey fabric, but the extra fabric just piles up on itself... the outer layer also doesnt feel like it will breath. add the cotton lining, and i think it will feel miserable in the heat of the texas summer. returning.",Negative
17260,"A very cute and comfy top thats lightweight and falls nicely... but, it does snag very easily. so far, ive worn this top once and found small snags in multiple areas. the snags might blend into the fabric texture if they did not create dark spots. the yarn/thread is a mixture of a celadon tone and black, which concentrates the black when snagged.",Negative

17265,I bought these shorts last week in the cobalt blue color. they are super comfy and the color is beautiful however after wearing them for only a few hours i noticed a pull in the fabric that all the way down the front of the right leg. im extremely upset about this because they were relatively expensive for lounge shorts. i love the shorts otherwise.,Negative
17268,"Not up to retailer standards! fabric quite thin(you could see nude-color bra through the white one) and thin fabric, wide bottom hung sloppy; no way i would feel well dressed in this top. i returned it.",Negative

17271,I am not in love with this top and will be returning it. from the front it looks like a basic tee (which i expected) but the back x is too loose and slumps to the side so that it doesnt look like an x as the picture shows. so basically the focal point of the tee falls short.,Negative

17289,"I thought this top would be a little more form fitting than it is. there is so much extra fabric near the bottom it is almost like a swing style top. the fabric will most definitely snag, as it is not a linen or cotton top material but rather a silky type and also very thin - not very good quality. i got the smallest size possible and it was absolutely huge, everywhere but the neck.",Negative
17290,Tried this top on in store in a small and it was a bit snug in the chest (32dd) but loved it otherwise. the sales associate had it shipped to me in a medium and it is perfect!! a great length over leggings or skinny jeans and is lightweight enough for warmer days or can be layered with a tank underneath and a cropped cardigan for colder ones.,Positive
17294,I loved the style and shape of the dress . it does run small. i had to return it because some of the black dots pulled and looked like it might be more of a problem as i wore it,Negative
17300,Love all things mes demoiselles and these do not disappoint! the gold does not show in the picture but they sure do sparkle...in a great way. the fabric is rich and can be worn all year as they are light weight for summer but carry a look perfect with sweaters. i love them and with the sale on sale they were a steal and happy to have them...they will be that one piece that i will grab again and again. i love the look of peasant blouses and shorter vests...in a contrast print would be incredible,Positive
17301,This suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal. it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out. i was very sad to return it :( i am a size 8 with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium,Negative
17305,"I loved the rich navy blue color with the accent pockets. the fabric was a nice weight, not too thin like lots of retailer tops. i liked the top from the front, however the back was way too long, especially with the looseness of the style. it would have been much better if it were not so much longer in the back and maybe a little more fitted. it might work on someone taller. im 53 and 120 lbs. and i tried xs.",Negative

17326,"Love this top for spring - great with athletic leggings, regular leggings or jeans. it is a lot longer in the back, which i like as it covers my butt and makes leggings work-appropriate. great quality. true to size - i am 59 and 128 lbs - xs fits perfectly. fabric is a little wrinkly but that is intentional. lighter material so it is good for spring weather, but sturdy enough not to be see through at all.",Positive
17327,"Im a tunic girl--have to admit that. for me this top is fab.  i love roomy, swingy tops and this is exactly that. as others have mentioned, it is quite roomy at the bottom, however the weight of the fabric is so light it lays very nicely.  i love how it fits in the arms. i hate when arms are too big. the sleeve fits snugly. for reference i am 55 140 lbs. the small fit perfectly. i have already worn several times to work. perfect in the a/c.",Positive

17347,I had high hopes for this top but once again it is just a big boxy too much material top. i get the style but if it adds 10lbs to your middle area its not for me. it is a thin material so it does hang nice.,Negative
17349,You cant go wrong with these pants. as other reviews point out when they say skinny they do mean that this is a skinny fit so order accordingly. i ordered a 4 when i have been wearing 2s in many other styles and was glad for the 4. i thought the fabric was all season so dont agree with some other reviewers regarding the stiffness of the fabric. i think its perfect. everyone is different. these are pretty close to year-round wearable.,Positive

the marigold color may be better than the black abut showing lint but something intrinsic to the fabric really attracts lint like nothing i have eve",Negative
17369,So flattering on my curvy (and busty) body.  so many swing style tops have too much fabric and make you look larger than you actually are.  not the case with this top - the fabric and cut make the bottom half flow beautifully; so flattering imo.  i usually wear a small or medium in meadow rue and went with the small.  the shoulders and arms fit my small bone structure perfectly; the burn out pattern and color are gorgeous.   can?t wait to wear!,Positive

17399,I love this top. the quality is topnotch and its true to size. its not skintight but its also not so roomy that you look pregnant! one thing that surprised me is that its a silk material. i thought it was linen or something like that. but i love it!,Positive

18315,"I really wanted to love this coat. it is well made and unique. i usually buy the petite versions but they were sold out.
however i went ahead and purchased a regular size because i wanted a second winter coat.
sadly, it looked more like a cocoon coat on me. it stuck out at the back. probably because it was not a petite. it pulled across my chest, like shoulders were too short. for reference, i am 5 feet, 109lbs, and a 32d.
i didnt mind the fluffiness of the top portion and the tie is useful for",Negative

18323,"I decided to take advantage of the free shipping despite seeing no reviews yet. i received the dress today and it is exactly as pictured, only about 3 inches shorter. i am usually between an xs and s but chose the xs because of late, everything i seem to order is huge. this was an exception and i could have ordered the s. color was as pictured, a nice green. fabric was a gauzy cotton. the dress was just alright. nothing special to warrant the price tag. it felt like a little girls dress on me",Negative
18324,"The orange version is very nice, bright but not tacky. the fit is super flattering, and i love the crisscrossed hem. the top part is also flattering on the shoulders (halter), but need a strapless bra. the 0 fit me well, no need for petite on that one, might be too short for me.

pattern is also gorgeous. recommend...",Positive
18325,"This top is very pretty, but it fits funny. its boxy and doesnt hang well. i feel like you could almost wear it as a 2nd-trimester-pregnancy-blouse. i tried the small & the small petite. they both fit the same (too big and too boxy), but the petite was shorter. i am 52, 125lbs, 34b. i preferred the regular length, but if you like your tops to end at your waistband, then the petite would fit too. i still really like the top, so i may try it in a smaller size when it goes on sale.",Negative
18326,"I have an hourglass shape and a large chest, so its difficult to find dresses that dont like im wearing a sack or are too form-fitting to be appropriate. this dress is prefect for accentuating my waist, while still looking appropriate for weddings and other nice events! the color is perfect",Positive

18329,"I wanted to love this top. but, it looks like an ambitious 12 year old made it with rumpled fabric and lace found in her grandmothers attic. re: hopeful, but not good. the quality is not good and it hangs strangely on. sadly it is going back.",Negative
18334,"I am a true size small and i ordered this dress and it was way big. its meant to be a relaxed fit, but it sagged under the arm-holes because the bust was way too big. some folks are saying it ran small and they are essentially the same measurements as me, so it makes me think there is possibly some variation in each size. i got on here to reorder in a smaller size, but now am not sure what to do as i need a dress with in the next three days!",Negative
18337,I found the fit of this dress odd. i typically wear a 6 or 8 in dresses. the 6 fit across the chest but the armholes were large so wearing a bra would be a challenge. i am a 34c so i need some type of support. i also thought the fabric was a bit flimsy for the price. i am a huge retailer fan and usually leave glowing reviews but sadly i left this one in the store.,Negative

i love the pleated neckline! i feel like an old hollywood beauty in this dress. great one retailer!",Positive
18344,"But, it just doesnt measure up. first, the slip/lining comes unattached if pulled slightly and it is very difficult to actually get it on - either stepping into it or pulling it over your head. and, once on, the top was a big snug and there was too much material at the bottom which made it look really bulky. unfortunately, i am finding this to be the case with so many of the items i buy from retailer lately. the material is really cute, but the dress isnt worth the price / effort.",Negative

18351,"Beautiful fabric and beautifully made, but the pockets ruin it... and i love pockets. you cannot see from the photos, but they protrude from the sides a few inches beyond the skirt, and look strange and unflattering, especially from the back. they are unfortunately placed right below the hips, and the effect is like those french bicycle baskets, panniers. if they were smaller and in the front, the dress would work. i am usually a size 4 and both the 2 and the 4 fit me well ? not too snug or to",Negative
18354,"I saw this dress online and really wanted to love it... unfortunately it wasnt at all as expected in person.

as the previous reviewer mentioned it is extremely itchy material, which was already pilling on many of the dresses displayed in the store. the neck was extremely tight; a problem ive never encountered with any retailer dress. additionally it seems to have a kangaroo pocket located right underneath the bust line, which protruded in an unflattering way. the pocket is not at all not",Negative

18359,This blouse is beautiful and true to size. i was so happy it fit after ordering it online. im a bit busty and broad but generally wear a m in most retailer tops and the m fit perfectly. length was perfect on me...not too long and not short. im 51 for reference. definitely a top that can be worn dressed up with slacks and heels or skinny jeans and flats. love it!,Positive
18361,I was so excited to get this dress...i even paid expedited shipping! i read the reviews and thought that i ordered properly but i sadly disappointed. it was just too big. im a size 6-8 petite and the size 8 was overwhelming. the side of the dress were down to my stomach and i just cant wear the dress. not sure what to do but buyers be careful. pretty color and design but not well-designed.,Negative
18366,"Loved the dress. loved the pattern and the cut. unfortunately it did not work for me. it is cut too low under the arm pits and therefore, showed too much breast. it is not made to wear a bra with either so that is not a solution. sticky boobs will not work either because it is the side breast that shows. i hated to have to send back but.....still looking for something similar and great!",Negative

18389,"This skirt is gorgeous. i love the dots, the heavy fabric, the slight metallic in the weave. it also has two exposed zippers, one on either side of the waist, which gives it an edgy vibe. a perfect counter balance to the 50s circle skirt cuteness. however, not knowing my size in tracy reese, i ordered my usual retailer size 4. i cannot even zip it. i measured it and the size 4 has a 24 inch waist. there is about an inch of give in the band, but the elastic is so heavy it would not be flattering to",Positive
18394,"This top is adorable in style and fit. which is why it breaks my heart that i cant recommend it. the embroidery snags so easily, when i wore it, i ended up with several tears in the threads, leaving the pattern a bit of a mess. it snagged on my rings, my watch and my purse. i returned it because of this. its really too bad, and i wish the design were printed on instead of sewn, simply because it would last a lot longer.",Negative
18401,"This shirt is gorgeous at first glance. the quality is there and it has a beautiful design...from the front, that is. but it is huge and billowy with back pleats. i cannot imagine this being flattering on anyone. it just adds so much volume to the top. i am thin and petite so maybe that was the issue, but i just cant see adding so much volume. this was a total miss for me. such a shame. would have been great without all the extra volume in back.",Negative
18402,"Normally i like to purchase from the store so i can try things on first, but this top wasnt available locally. i guessed on a medium. im 55 and very curvy and the medium fits just like the picture on the model. just a hint of a sleeve and nice and drapey-loose over the body. the embroidery is just beautiful. the only reason im not giving 5 stars for quality is that i had to sew two buttons onto the back, my top came without them.",Positive

i do agree that this romper is on the shorter side but i liked that about it. it is far more flattering than the modeling photos online. it doesnt look that oversized. i can see where taller ladies wont go for the shortness but at 54 thats just not an issue for me. the bottom is very flattering and doesnt do that long grandma butt that some rompers",Positive
19509,"I actually like this better on the instagram picture than on the model... anyway, i ordered the xs petite (for 115 lbs, 51.5) and it fits really nicely. not too short. the material is nice and soft, nad looks like it may not wrinkles, which would be a bonus... the little gold buttons are super cute, but you cant really wear this untied, so it is pretty much a strictly tied short. sleeves are flattering... i think i may keep it :-)",Positive
19517,"This product was very disappointing. fabric was thin, it has no shape and hangs like a pajama top. so its not flattering at all. at $78, its really overpriced for what it is. it might look good on someone who has the perfect body shape (what wouldnt?), but they would probably still look like they went out in their pjs. im 59 and not well-endowed (a b), so it did nothing for me..

also, the online picture of the moss version looks like its a grey/black combo. its not... it is really green",Negative

19527,Wasnt sure what to expect but i like it. ordered size large and its a perfect fit. the color is a blush beige. it falls at the top of my hips. i dont think you need a camo under it because the holes are small. its a sweater type knit thats substantial but not heavy.  love that it ties at the shoulder to adjust the fit and length.,Positive
19529,"I love dark colors and i loved the summer touch to this top that i feel like i can wear it year round! the little anchors on the buttons are such a cute touch (very retailer). it does run slightly smaller, but not in an extreme way. id love to see more styling options for this top because im a little stumped at how to wear it outside of my white high waisted shorts, haha.",Positive

19551,The armholes on this dress are totally bizarre. i cant believe no one else has commented on them yet. i am a size s on top and m on the bottom so i usually try on both in dresses. i tend to be a small/ size 6 in retailer. the armholes are so long that the dress doesnt lay right on top. i showed it to on of the clerks in the store and she agreed with me. we looked at all the others and they were the same. going up a size made it way worse. this dress might work for someone with really broad shoul,Negative

19667,"I ordered the white and the light blue in size xl. both are cut much smaller than is typical for my other retailer xl blouses. everything the first reviewer wrote is true. the photos of the white top show a detailed back when it is plain (like the blue). the back is just a solid, kind of slippery material. its strange because its not see-through in the back but you need to wear a tank/cami for the front. so, it makes the shirt that much tighter since you need to have the extra layer.

19670,I agree with the other reviewers. this shirt is cuter in person. it is a flattering cut and the design is even prettier than in the photos. the color is more navy--not the charcoal color it looks in the photos. the stitching is also more colorful in real life.,Positive

purchased during the first days of the tag sale. runs large (i.e. i typically wear m-l, and ended up going with a small!). definitely need a tank underneath, as the hook does not close the top of fully. like the blue color; the pink is more of a peach and made me look incredibly washed out.

20779,This dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline. but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area--so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty. a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just didnt feel comfortable about. some darts could have made a nicer fit here. but this is a a great dress if you dont mind a super body con fit.,Negative

21291,The colors of this top are even better in person. the blue is easy to pair with denim and there is no need to accessorize -- the print does all the talking! it is a bit wide on the bottom and the print material is pretty thin. it definitely looks like something not everyone else has - worth the splurge.,Positive

21409,"Recently started loving rockets. i own a pair in black and a pair that are distressed. ive found that the 27s fit me best. i am 57, 34c, 28 waist. this particular pair seems to run true to size, meaning i could get the 28s on (which is typically what i wear in other brands), but the 27s were embarassingly too small. while the 28s fit, and are made of a great weighty denim, with very little stretch, the wash was really not appealing. due to the distressing of the wash, all the lines butterfly",Negative

21482,"I purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet. the style is very cute, but the fabric is quite thin. she will have to make that call, but if i had bought it for myself, it would be going back. im not willing to wear a camisole under a t-shirt. it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when its washed, so that remains to be seen.",Negative
21483,These shorts are wonderful! very stylish and easy to pair with my tops. they do run a bit large. i am normally a size 8 or 29. i ordered these in a medium and i definitely could have gone with small. they are machine washable though and im not sure if they will shrink at all so im keeping them. i would definitely recommend them.,Positive
21486,"I got this piece because it was so unique.. thats one of the things i love so much about retailer: not afraid to go where no woman has gone before, so i ordered it in a 4p, my usual size, and a 4. i am petite, but the 4 worked perfectly, i think. i am pretty voluptuous below the waist and medium to small on the top and the 4p was too small all over - so i would agree that it runs small.

just didnt work on my slim build. :(",Negative

21837,"I love cloth and stone and the softness and prettiness of this fabric did not disappoint. this is not a dress, however. it is a long shirt. the sides were so short the you could see where my bum and hamstrings came together. leggings would ruin the look and as a shirt it would be totally impractical. for reference i am 58 and 130 lbs. the small was the correct size, save for the length.",Negative

21847,"This tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole. first of all, the armhole is way too low! second, there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm. since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem. no need for the side zipper, it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side.",Negative

its a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted. if only they had been made out of actual jeans material.",Negative
21884,I dont buy many jackets (retired) but i think they are still useful. i had my doubts about this jacket -- like could they really get the trim straight at this price? but they did. the jacket is casual but sophisticated. i got the grey and the color is just as pictured. i will probably wear with dark jeans and i see several creative mashups with things in my closet. i am pleased and i think you will be too!,Positive

22026,"I wanted to love this top so badly. between the beautiful photos and the good reviews, i didnt think i could go wrong with it. unfortunately, it just didnt look great on. the bust area sagged on my smaller chest, and then the top flared way out from the waist down. it doesnt lay even remotely flat like the photos would have you believe. maybe this would look better on hourglass or slim types. the quality does appear to be good -- the material is weighty and soft.",Negative
22033,"After reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it, i loved the fabric and color, however it was so ill-fitting. its like the designer didnt even use female measurements and used a box to make this top--too wide. i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly. it is too wide and not long enough. both are going back!",Negative
22039,"Beautiful fabric, but the fit was off. the picture makes the dress appear fitted than it actually is. the belt is definitely needed, but would leave a lot of fabric in the back of the dress giving it a less than tailored look. 

also, the arms and the top portion are a tad small, so if you have a larger bust/arms, this dress may be tricky. i am a 34b and the button in the xxsp was puckering a bit.i was really looking forward to this one for fall, but was no way for me to make it work.",Negative
22041,"Whatever happened to sizing! pretty print and color but has enough fabric for 2 tops. it is also unlined which is not a huge issue. i wore it with a cami. the arms werent too gaping for me, thankfully. i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides. i am 140 lbs and got the small. should have gone 1 or even 2 sizes smaller.",Negative
22043,"This dress is absolutely lovely. i couldnt leave the store without it, even though it was full price and i have a million dresses. its just that great. i am 5 8 130 lbs and bought the small",Negative
22044,This shirt has it all. great staple piece to add to your wardrobe. not only is it classy with a pair of black pants and booties but you can add a little spice to it by dressing it up with some funky earrings. found it to be a bit large in the armpit area so i sized down.,Positive
22045,"I love this feminine blouse and the gorgeous colors on! its a fresh shape that is truly flattering. i like that it comes in specific sizes so the proportions seem accurate. i bought the 8 in peach; all the colors are very pretty. i am a usual 8/medium and am 34f, so the regular bra-friendliness is essential. this is a new, fuller shape for me. im on a quest at this time of year for clothing that feels comfortable in the beginning heat of summer, and this is a lovely choice. you could pair it w",Positive
22046,This shirt is a steal at the sale price. ive received many compliments. it is a swing top- so not a lot of form. i wear a cami underneath & have found the style to be comfortable for work.,Positive

22057,"Im not typically a fan of pilcro pants compared to paige or other brands like j brand, however, these simple black skinny jeans were just what i was looking for. they hit perfectly at the ankle and look great with a bootie. they are quite stretchy and i like my black jeans truly like a legging, so i sized down 1.5 sizes. im typically between a 30 and 31 and i purchased a 29 in these. initially they were snug around the waist but eased with wear. the material is flexible yet sturdy.",Positive
22064,"I love this top - it has the pattern and detailing that i feel like retailer used to do consistently, but often skimps on now. tit definitely runs small - i usually wear a 6 in retailer tops (sometimes a 4) and the 8 is quite fitted on me.",Positive
22065,"I bought this t-shirt in pink, blue, red, grey and black over the past year. every one of them except the grey, has gotten little pin holes in the front of the shirt below your waistline. ive returned them all. the fabric is thin and the quality of the t/shirt is terrible.",Negative
22066,"This is a gorgeous blouse, but it runs small in my opinion. i consistently wear a size 2 in moulinette soeurs, and im trying to decide if a 4 will still be too small, and if i need to exchange for a 6. construction and materials are lovely, just consider sizing up if you purchase this blouse.",Positive
22073,"This top is very pretty and figure-flattering because of the way it nips in under the bust. the neckline and color are also flattering. however, it runs a bit small and you need to get the right fit for the bust, balancing the band under the bustline with the roominess of the chest area. there is a side zipper but it can still be a little tricky to get on and off. i wound up not buying it due to the price, but id probably snap it on sale.",Positive
22076,"Beautiful,delicate and unique cotton blouse that accentuates the waist and falls nicely down the belly. i love the floral print, very appropriate for spring/summer. i agree with the other reviewers whove mentioned that it runs small. i have a bust size of 34 dd and waist size 25 and i had to size up to 12. nevertheless, i am really looking forward to wearing this with a pair of skinny jeans and some nude pumps for a girls night out.",Positive
22080,"What a beautiful harbinger of spring! this blouse is so lovely and uplifting. for me, tts. i bought the size 4 (34-b) and it fits perfectly. this is a fitted blouse especially in the waistline so, i understand why some say size up. the print is pretty with muted shades of pinks and burgundies. the detailing of beige lace and the tiny buttons on the waist adds a very feminine touch along with the added interest on the back of the blouse. the fabric is soft but not overly sheer.",Positive
22083,"This dress is probably the most comfortable dress ive ever had! the fabric is very comfortable and breathable, and it flatters my straight body type.",Positive
22089,"This is a very pretty blouse. the fabric is lightweight and very soft. i read the other reviews and this does run very small, i ordered two sizes larger than i normally would and it fits very nicely.",Positive
22091,"I had really high hopes for this shirt after reading the reviews. first off it runs really small. i usually wear a small or medium ( 4 or 6) i couldnt even get the 6 on. i probably could have even done a 10. the fabric was extremely flimsy. i was almost afraid i was going to rip it taking it off. other than the sizing and the fabric, it just wasnt flattering on me.",Negative
22094,"I love it! the fit is very flattering. i read in another review that the top runs small, so i got a small instead of an extra small and it fits perfectly.",Positive
22096,"Loved this online, but the xs was too big and the material was too bulky.",Negative
22098,"This dress was gifted to me and is a perfect compliment to the holidays. i cant wait to wear it! the bottom portions shines (i am a devoted lover of all things sparkle and shine) but it really stands out with the darker background. the pleats hide imperfections in body shape and would make a flattering dress on most figures. i also like that the top layer extends below the bottom one, leaving little extra sheer to tastefully show more leg.",Positive

22116,"These are the best leggings i have ever worn - and i wear a lot of leggings. i am 5 8 tall and 127lbs. i bought a s/m. they very soft and warm. they stay up perfectly, and do not pinch or make any lines. i am amazed that they are so inexpensive. i am buying 2 more after this review!",Positive
22120,"These leggings are amazing. by far one of the most comfortable pairs that i own! i should have ordered more. i got a m/l and they fit perfect. the detailing is awesome, and they even stay opaque when you sit, so you dont have to worry about them being see-through. great buy!",Positive
22125,"This skirt looks and feels cheap, and the color is much more green than pictured. additionally, i comfortably wore a size 4 and then lost a few pounds, and this is still way too tight to be flattering.",Negative
22126,Super itchy! had to return.,Negative
22130,"My husband rarely seems this pleased and he always likes to see what i try on. oohs and aaaahs galore with this one! lets let him review this one....he says he loves the vibrant color, length, and the way the top is perfectly fitted. he was impressed with the lining and the mesh at the hem that keeps the flare in the skirt (i had to explain that one)! he likes the way it looks with a sweater and without and said that i could use more than one of the many pairs of shoes with it that he sees",Positive
22132,"The material, deep color and design are gorgeous. however, the dress is just too bulky for my 52 and 110lb frame. i ordered a 0p, and it just wasnt flattering on me. its somewhat tent-shaped so the fact that its not at all fitted and has a thick lining made me look larger than i actually am. im so disappointed because the dress really is beautiful otherwise.",Negative
22133,I have these in grey and i love them! they are so comfy. i got them in m/l even though i am a s/m because i like the loose fit. they are very soft.,Positive
22134,"I really wanted to love this shirt. it looked so nice and cool for summer and i dont own anything purple. the color was really nice, very subtly feminine. i am a little too short for this style though. i am 5 ft. 1 inch, 105 lbs ordered an xxs and it was still too wide. the side slits came up a little too high for my liking, but i easily couldve stitched those up a bit and theyd have been fine. i think this would look great on taller women, but on me it looked like a dumpy sack.",Negative
22136,I needed a legging to wear with boots. makes sense that if it is cold enough to wear boots in socal then it is too cold to wear thin leggings. try to find warm leggings....almost impossible until retailer put fleece lined leggings in their catalogue! the leggings have a vertical knitted stripe which elongates the leg and they are warm! perfection in garments is very rare but these leggings are hot.,Positive

22139,I usually wear a 6 and ordered two other skirts at the same time. the other skirts fit perfectly and this one was more like a size 2. very disappointed for i really liked the idea of it.,Negative
22144,"I had high hopes for this top, as it looked great online. unfortunately it was much more ruffly in person and not my style at all. it was a lot of fabric and poofed out too much -- reminded me of a childs top. sad to return it!",Negative
22145,Im a size 28 jeans 59 with a bubble bottom. these were falling off of me around the hips. these are warm. i was expecting them to not be sheer since they are fleece lined but when i sat down i was shocked to notice it. it doesnt matter functionality wise because i never felt a draft. they look good and are well made but i will be returning due to the lack of fit.,Negative
22148,"Truly the only word that comes to mind when i think of this dress is dazzling! the pictures online just barely do it justice...if you have an retailer nearby, check to see if its available in store and go check it out in person. it does not disappoint! every year around this time, our beloved retailer seems to come out with this style of dress. in the years past they have all been different and beautiful, but i think they have truly outdone themselves this year. this dress is a deep emerald green...",Positive
22150,"These are my new favorite leggings. they have everything i need - soft waist band that doesnt squeeze me at all, not overly long, subtle ribbed texture (black pair) that make them feel just a little nicer, and most importantly they are not see thru at all. so soft on the inside too. and this price is nuts too, im so happy with these!",Positive
22154,"Maybe its just me, but this skirt had a little more volume than i was expecting. im 57, around 125lbs and the small fit me well. i like that the waist is elastic in back providing some give, but allowing the front to look smooth. pockets are always great. i got a striped henley from retailer (which is awesome) to tuck into it & was excited for the 70s vibe.

22159,"I couldnt believe the bargain price of these leggings, so i took a chance and ordered all 3 colors. when they arrived, i was equally pleased to see how soft, cozy and warm they were and how nice they looked with all my oversized tops. also interesting is that the textures of all 3 are different. the black has a vertical lined texture, the lavender has a cable weave texture and the gray is untextured. wearing them is going to be a pleasure!",Positive
22160,"Loved this dress. fit like a glove, so flattering, and perfect for a summer/fall wedding. material is substantial and dress is well made. im 54, large chest, and curvy, and a size 6 fit perfectly. longer than seen on the model for me, but i actually love it being tea-length. 

a strip of tulle attached to the lining underneath the skirt to help it poof. i removed it, but looks good either way.",Positive

22171,Im 140 at 5 8. pear shape. the pockets really opened up when i put them on and didnt lay flat. loose on leg opening - which i liked. but the pockets sticking out around the hip area made my pear shape even wider. i got a medium,Negative

22177,I couldnt even figure out how to wear this sweater the fit was so odd. the arms cut off short and the seams dont hit your shoulders where they should. all the extra fabric around the collar is just confusing and unflattering. moving around in it was not easy. i will return this one!,Negative
22184,"Love tiny. i am 57, 125-128 lbs depending on the day, and a 34a. i also have a very long torso, and tiny shirts are one of the few brands that are usually long enough for me. this one, however, was a huge miss. i ordered online in my usual tiny xs. it was much too big around and felt shorter in the front than stated, so it looked boxy on me. however, the worst part was the placket. the description doesnt note that its held together with a tiny snap. that snap takes nothing to undo, and then",Negative

22198,"It looks adorable in the picture... but just not flattering in real life. too much fabric in the skirt that flares from the waist in a bunchy, unflattering way. makes a slender but curvy figure look boxy, rather than enhancing curves. its a pass. love the blue print, though.",Negative
22199,I am 5 5 150 lb and i usually wear a 10 or 12 in tops because i dont like clothing too tight on top. i took a chance and got the xl because it was all that remained. now i wish i could be more! please bring this back retailer!,Positive

22331,"I fell in love with this dress as soon as i saw it. it does fit more loosely than i typically prefer, but the colors and the patterns have such personality that it didnt matter. i wear mine both as a dress and with leggings for the windy days. this is one of my new favorites!",Positive

22340,I am so sad that this romper didnt work out. its just way too billowy and huge. i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small. im petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper! might look best on taller girls. i am 5 2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent. do not recommend. such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews!,Negative

22346,"I followed the other reviews and sized down. normally, im a small/medium in retailer (58/135 for clarification) and i expected the garment to be a bit roomy. i ordered the small and when it arrived i almost called the corporate office to ensure i didnt have to pay rent on the romper, given that you could comfortably fit a small family of five in it. oddly, the arm-holes were normal sized? i returned this mess.",Negative

22380,"I was so pleased to see this in the store, and i am glad that i had a chance to feel the knit. the combination of wool, cotton, and nylon creates a really soft, luxurious feel to the sweater. i was shocked that it didnt have cashmere in the blend, it is that soft! but, it is equally substantial. this sweater can surely be worn as a piece of outerwear, and it can be used as a layering piece. i consider this one tts because i typically wear a m in a knit that isnt fitted. i disagree with an earl",Positive

22433,I love this design so much and it is very well made. i also like the adjustable shoulder straps and that the cups are not padded cups. i think that makes it look less like a bra and more like a bathing suit. only con is that it seems to run small.,Positive
22434,"I love the design of this top, however, its quality is lackluster. the shirt is pretty short and would be more flattering (at least on me) if it had a few more inches. also its pretty sheer, so figuring out under garments is a dilemma. i will still wear it because i love it. looks great with a denim vest over it!",Negative

22805,"I bought this mainly because i have a similar one in the mustard colorway and i love how this flows. the color is definitely one you dont see a lot of, which is what makes it special. i could see it running a tad large, but i think its pretty true to size. now im debating about buying it in blush!",Positive
22810,"Im 53 about 130lbs and ordered a size 6. the print on the fabric is as expected but the shape of the dress and fit were not good at all. i probably would wear a 4 instead of the 6, but could tell that even if i had the 4, the cut of it still wouldnt be flattering on me at all. it was baggy in odd places and had no shape. the outer fabric is very sheer and see through and the lining is nice, with a fitted slip design.",Negative

22826,"This has a cute aesthetic on the hanger but not so great on- at least for my body type. i am 510 with broad shoulders and slim, and both the arms and dress length were too short. in addition, the size 8 was boxy and unflattering. sizing down to a 6 would have exacerbated the length issues.",Negative
22827,Im 51 and a tad busty and this sweater i found to be most flattering. i saw it i. the store on was drawn to it. i love the shimmer but perhaps thats because the holiday feel is already in the air in nyc. the m fit great in both length pans width. it looked great with my straight black jeans and boots. i felt it made me look thin. thankful i bought it on a discount day! its a fabulous sweater.,Positive
22829,So cute! a definite add for this summer. sizing and pattern are both on-point. would be cute with so many bottoms,Positive

22849,"I bought this sweater online as soon as i saw it. but like the other reviewers i agree it is shapeless and sticks out too much at and below the waist. if it were a softer fabric maybe the flair would work but not for this one. i am 5 2, 115lbs, 32d and got the xs. maybe if you arent chesty it wont flare out as much. sadly i had to return it. i was so excited for it, o well.",Negative

22866,This sweater did not flatter a sz 12 with 36d chest. its very well made but not for the curvy girl. this is my very first review and felt compelled to share my thoughts since i heavily rely on others reviews before i purchase.,Negative
22873,These pants look nice and are comfortable but the quality of the fabric is terrible! i should not be surprised because i bought another pair of pants by this same label at antro earlier this year and they did not hold up at all either. but i thought id give it another shot. never again! im on my 5th wear and the crotch and inner thighs have worn away completely...i mean huge holes in the fabric where its just disintegrated. even at extra % off the sale price its not worth it. the full price,Negative

22881,"I love drop shoulder sweaters and find them to be very flattering so i took a chance on this one despite the reviews stating it runs very large. i was attracted to the style as well as the natural cotton fiber, which i find holds up best over time. i am 34b and usually wear xs or small and in this i ordered the xs. it fits perfectly! i layered this soft pink sweater over a rounded hem tee with a black and white pattern; so cute! it is slightly short on my 58 frame so the shirt tail hems peeked",Positive
22885,"Bummer, i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen. seriously looks maternity to me. the neck is also too wide. the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didnt work on me. i returned this one.",Negative
22888,Good reason to read reviews. i concur with others in that it fins large and looks boxy. heavy fabric makes matters worse.,Negative
22894,"While i loved the sleeves on this sweater (the lace detailing was beautiful) the core area was really big. i agree with another reviewer who said it looked like a maternity top. i was hopeful but i sent it back. i am 57, 128lb and ordered the small.",Negative
22897,"While i loved the material, color and concept of the dress, it was much too large and sack-like. im 52 and 108 lbs, pear-shaped. i purchased the regular xs given stated length in the description. while the length was just right, it was just much too large throughout. im not sure that even an xxs will help so sadly, this will be going back.",Negative
22898,This sweater is even better looking in person. the body of the sweater is substantial - a nice weight. the lace is gorgeous. i usually wear a size large but found the sleeves really long. i purchased a medium and it fits better - sleeves are perfect.,Positive

22918,"Slouchy, longer in the sleeves, a little cropped, great neckline, stylish.....these are just some of the reasons i absolutely love this sweater! ive been looking for a style like this for a long time. i went down a size because of the wide neckline and the fact that it is a bit oversized. im petite, 119 lbs., with a 32f bust size. i went with the grey, but im loving it so much i might pick one up in the pink. so comfy and cozy and chic!!",Positive

22937,This is another item ive been stalking that i thought miraculously made it to sale with my size still available. i ordered online but when it arrived i have to be honest i didnt even try it on because i knew it would be going back. the beautiful print online looks really cheap irl on the flimsy fabric. the beaded detail on neck is basically a low grade sequin trim. so much potential just executed poorly.,Negative

22940,"I went with my usual size, but it is too tight, it fits, but i would feel uncomfortable in it. i ordered the pink one, which looks nice in the picture, but in person, it looks cheap. the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the 1970s. that beaded neckline added to the cheap look. this one is not for me.",Negative
22942,"I just bought this and i really disagree with previous review that it runs big - i wear an 8 in skirts and bought another retailer skirt last week that fits just fine - this one does not even zip up. i might exchange for bigger size, as label is just a number to me and sizes are really inconsistent - or it may just go back.",Negative
22945,"I almost never buy anything full price here and usually wait patiently for a sale + promotion :) however, this really struck me and i decided to buy it, telling myself its an investment piece for years to come. its just so unique and beautiful -- the things that makes retailer unique that arent as common anymore.

22960,"This is a dress for a princess. i admire this dress so much, online and in person. i tried on this dress a few times every time i visited the store. the beads throughout the dress provide a low-key surprise sparkle, especially in the sun. the colors are much more vibrant in person, which is breathtaking against the light cream background. the fabric is soft and flowy. unfortunately for me, it doesnt fit right. size 6 fits well but the arm holes are too big and the midi part makes me look frumpy",Positive

22975,"I loved these pants and purchased them in three colors. like another reviewer, within a few weeks, having worn them no more than a couple of times, the fabric in the crotch area started to wear thin and two pairs developed holes. i was not hard on the pants - just wore them to the office - and line dried them. so disappointing, as i really did love the pants. total waste of money.",Negative

22991,"I liked this top, i really did. i also liked the subtle shimmer. the fabric didnt seem as soft, but i could not get over the big difference in length between the front and the back. you can see it on the model here, but when i tried it on it was even more obvious and just didnt look right. asymmetrical tops look better when the length difference is not so large, but here it is. the print at the top also made my shoulders look a little broader. i am sending it back.",Negative
22995,"Oh what a disappointment! i was looking forward to wearing this as a layering piece with the shawl cardigan. the material lacks serious quality and it was ripped on the seam. so, back it goes. and, i am flabbergasted at the price retailer is charging almost $60 for this top!",Negative

23089,The top of this suit was not proportioned well. i am normally a 34c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium. the cup size on this was very small for a medium. the band to hook in the back was almost too big. there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup. the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back.,Negative

23391,"The model looks awesome in this cute top, but on me it looked boxy but was too tight around the chest and was too short (for reference, im 57, 140 lbs., and 34c). the front is non-stretchy eyelet lace cotton fabric, yet the back is stretchy. in theory, its pretty, but in reality it doesnt work - at least for me. i think it might work for someone petite with a smaller chest.",Negative
23399,"I... love... this dress. the fit is incredibly flattering (and im currently carrying more weight than my normal size). i selected a 6, which is about a size larger than normal, and it was a perfect fit. i tried on a larger size for measure, and the 6 provided a (perfect) fit and flare. ive worn the dress on three occasions, already, and each time friends remarked on their admiration for the dress, itself and flattering style for me, i have no issues, at all, with the cut, and to me, the bias a",Positive
23401,"This is a precious! its a little thin, as i prefer a thicker fabric. however, wearing a tank top under it works perfectly. i have it now in both colors! great price on sale!",Positive
23405,"Im petite, and i knew buying this that it would be a big sweater - that is the look that is portrayed on the model. the sweater is scratchy, the neck was so big and bulky i had trouble making it lay right. it looks great on the model here, but not on me. going back. so bummed. the color gray is true to what is shown and it has little holes or openings across the shoulders. so there is a tiny bit of detail. overall, not a great sweater.",Negative
23406,"I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer. for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses. the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all. the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown. this dress has no shape to it, although probably comfortable, not flattering. i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture, in person.",Negative
23407,"This dress is very flattering, comfortable and made me feel pretty!",Positive
23408,I love this dress but it definitely runs big. i bought a size small and im between a 4 and a 6 and will have to return for an xs. the top feels like it will fall down and im a size 34c,Positive
23409,So soft!! such beautiful fabric!! it flows so gracefully and looks lovely with black leggings as pictured. one of my favorite retailer purchases to date...,Positive
23410,"This skirt runs small because of the stitching around the hips. the waist fit fine but the hips were very snug, and im relatively slim in the hips.",Negative
23417,Can i tell you this top is amazing?! get it quick before it sells out!!,Positive
23419,This skirt is so cute. this is a staple to have in your wardrobe. i wear it with boots and boot socks. but tights for cold winter days as well as flip flops in the summer. i got my true size of 4. its fits perfectly. i love the length with a peek of leg when you walk!,Positive
23423,"This top is similar to other tiny tops that i have ordered in the past...beautiful embroidery, great neutral and metallic color pallet that goes with everything, and light weight. the top does run small, so i needed the large size to accommodate my 38in bust plus a thin cami (shirt is see through). the large fit similarly to the fit on the model.",Positive
23424,Before i ordered this i noted the other reviews that said it was sheer but thought i would just wear a layer underneath. unfortunately it was one of the sheerest fabrics ive ever seen. would love it if it could have been a more substantial fabric. to me it wasnt worth the money even on sale.,Negative
23427,"What drew me to this shirt was the beautiful silver and gold embroidery on the front. the shirt was folded at the store, which makes sense because if it were hung it up, fewer people would try it on. this shirt is sheer from the front and more sheer in the back. this is what bugs me about so many clothes that are made these days: they are so cheaply made, so thin with cloth, that you are forced to layer with a camisole or something else in order to wear it in public. i cant wear sheer clothes",Negative
23428,I must say that at first i had mixed feelings about this sweater. i was actually going to return it because i was unsure about the style and color. the color is to me like a lavender mauv-ish color but the description is actually natural . i must admit that in some light it looks more brown then lavender . regardless i think that in itself tells you that this sweater is not like any other. i actually wear it as a coat and its become an essential part of my wardrobe. i found the size to be true,Positive
23433,"The online pictures do not do this dress justice. the materials between the top and skirt are different with the black part being a soft, sweater feel and the bottom part being an appropriately thick knit feel. the contract is stunning and is largely washed out in the online pictures. this is not the kind of dress you see on a rack and think oh my gosh, thats the one! but if you try it on, you will have this moment. it is comfortable, flattering, and slimming-a prefect everyday dress.",Positive
23436,Im 56 and it hits me at mid-thigh. the top (black/camel version) is sheer enough to need a cami. the waist is quite high. not flattering for me--the empire waist makes me look a bit pregnant--plus i dont want to deal with having to wear a cami.,Negative
23437,"This dress is so cute in the photo and fit true to size, but the material is slinky and felt cheap. the stitching was also poor quality. i am so thankful that retailer will let us order a batch, try on and return in store...this went back.",Negative
23443,"Love this cardigan as a wardrobe staple to quickly throw on, especially over dresses (but also anything). it drapes beautifully, and i love the button closure detail. it is definitely a thin, soft, light-weight knit, but i think that makes it practical for year-round use, much like other items by bordeaux.",Positive
23447,I really wanted to like this dress and was encouraged by the positive reviews. the dress itself was very comfortable but was very unflattering. the top fabric hit my ribs funny and made me look really wide.,Negative
23449,"I tried these on because the color is really pretty and fun, and who donset want a pair of comfy/cute pants... but they looked awful on my muscular thighs... i dont think the cut will be falttering on 99% of the population. also, not as comfortable as they looked, the crotch seemed a little low on me, though the pants were in the correct size.",Negative
23450,I wanted to love this jacket. so soft and great color. unfortunately it is just too light weight. it is almost like shirt fabric. nice heft to the fabric though. nice length - accept the sleeves were short on me. i am 510 and 135lbs. the small was the right size. i was looking for something slightly warmer to layer.,Negative
23458,This is my new favorite sweater. it is lightweight and drapey. very flattering. can be dressy or casual.,Positive
23460,"I purchased this for a very good price and i typically love maeve... should have been a win-win. the fabric is thin and slinky in the most unfortunate way. it made finding appropriate undergarments very difficult. i had to add a slip (that helped) and figured that since im losing weight, it would look better when im down a few more pounds. that being said, i didnt find it to be figure flattering. i have a tummy and there was at least one photo from the bridal shower i wore this to, where i lo",Negative
23465,I bought this dress for work and post work happy hours. love it! its material is high quality and is flattering since it falls nicely on my postpartum figure. its a little shorter than i thought but still appropriate for work.,Positive
23467,"I worry when i have an elastic waist, or something that resembles this, but the dress hangs like a dream.
no puffing out, no gathers that you can see.
it is not sheath, but not a line either, kind of in between, hits several inches above my knees, but perfect with some black tights for winter. i saw the note about grey, have to try it on agin in daylight, but i would say think black on the top, light camel color on the bottom
i am 58, typically wear a size 12, and it was true to size for me

23472,"I saw the shirt on the retailer website and new i had to have it. when it arrived, it was perfectly draped, light and airy, and incredibly soft and comfortable.  its perfect to throw on with yoga pants for errands or dress up a bit a casual night out with friends. would buy this again in several different colors if they were offered. 9/10.",Positive
23473,"Great quality and extremely flattering. bonus that it is on sale. i felt like this dress was a godsend. i am five months pregnant and needed a dress that made me feel comfortable but not frumpy. i think ill get a lot of mileage out of it, as theres enough stretch to get me through the next few months and then (hopefully!) i can wear it after too. also can be dressed up or down, so appropriate for many occasions. i believe it runs true to size (i sized up, from xs to s, for obvious reasons, but",Positive
23478,I was surprised at the positive reviews for this product. its terrible! it cuts you in a weird place to make you look wide. the skirt is also not like the picture. its darker and heavier. the material isnt great. i had to return.,Negative
23483,"This fit well, but the top was very see through. this never would have worked for me. im glad i was able to try it on in the store and didnt order it online. with different fabric, it would have been great.",Negative
23485,"This dress in a lovely platinum is feminine and fits perfectly, easy to wear and comfy, too! highly recommend!",Positive
