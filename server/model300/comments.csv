1,Not worth the money. Color is great and fits true to size but this cardigan is really thin and not warm at all,Negative
2,"Not for me, maybe I wanted to look like the model in the picture. I ordered S, but the dress is a bit loose at the bust. I think it would be ok if I was 20 :-(",Negative
3,Told to return the dress at my cost and that I would expect refund. Month later and still dealing with their incompetence. Color was fine. Material is cheap and loose strings everywhere.,Negative
4,Material was not what I expected and dress looks different in pictures. It is more form fitting and doesn’t cover your stomach from the side making you look big.,Negative
5,"Disappointed. It's more like a polyester 1950s tunic than a dress, it's loose on top with a tight fitting skirt which I found too short (and I'm 5'2""). I'll wear this as a top/tunic but not as a dress. Probably better on someone who has a bigger bust and small hip.",Negative
6,Size chart is way off - Dress doesn't fit well. It's very short. Bottom too tight and too big. Not even worth sending back.,Negative
7,"Honestly I am kinda of speechless. I don’t even know how to write this review and sound like a credible human being, but this dress smells like medicine. Like it stinks so bad like chemical drugs I am disgusted. I am sending it back ",Negative
8,This dress feels like the same material used to make Party City Halloween costumes.... super cheap quality... not impressed,Negative
9,"Bought this dress because of all the rave reviews. I should have known buying something so cheap would look... well... cheap. It fits - but it's actually not super forgiving on the bottom. I bought a white in Large, the white was a very blue-white (not so flattering) and it really only looked ok wearing it the strapless style. Might use it as a coverup but that's it. ",Negative
10,I love the colour of this dress but the material isn't the greatest. It clings to your muffin top . I ended up wearing it like a shirt instead to give it a bit of gathering around the stomach area to hide areas I am insecure about.,Negative
11,It’s a beautiful dress it keep on wanting to ride at the back of your shoulders though and when you walk it rides up past your thighs and ends up looking like a blouse. I would not buy this again. ,Negative
12,"This dress is made of poor quality material. it is as it appears in the picture , but fits a little bigger than I thought. Should be tighter around the body. The quality of material is very cheap. I probably would not buy again.",Negative
13,"Well....lookin wonderful when you don't move! But with every single step, dress moving up till your underwear is showing lol. Definitely not for an occassion when you wanna dance and move around. Refund requested.",Negative
14,"Ordered a size larger but it still looked like I squeezed into my teenagers dress.I don't recommend this product. It's not worth the price, time and headaches that come with returns. ",Negative
15,"The fabric for this dress, was transluscent. The dress was also too short, maybe I am just too tall. I like the options you have with how you wear this dress, so.... paired it with jeans and wear it as a shirt. Super cute.",Negative
16,I ordered this dress in lime green. It fit perfectly but my only issue is that the material looks super cheap in bright lighting. Almost like barbie doll material. The material that hangs down over the front conceals your abdomen area so you don't have to tuck in your stomach.,Positive
18,"I was not gifted with height this cute white dress is a little too short, I’m 5'. The skirt rides up and you always have to pull it down. Maybe a bigger size than small would have been a better choice for me. Using the dress as a shirt  was magnificent. The material is soft and see through if you use it as a dress. ",Negative
22,I wear a small and orderd a small but it was way too tight but it was very pretty though. The photos make it seem like the material is similar to stretchy undergarment fabric. This is not at all what I was expecting. The top piece of the dress material is tinier than the picture as well. ,Negative
24,This is a great little dress! It has tons of stretch so super comfy. The only thing is the photo shows a pencil skirt when it actually is gathered on each side of the skirt so it does rise a bit on the sides but still looks great! It's lovely that yu can adjust the height of the dress ,Positive
25,"I absolutely like the top half of this dress. However, the elastic gathering of the skirt part of the dress is a huge boooo. It makes the length too short and slides up your body when you walk. Perhaps this would have been solved by having a bigger bum. If the dress stayed put, this would have been a favorite of mine.  I will not return it, I will try to make it work with jeggings. ",Negative
26,"Amazing dress, true to description and picture. Fits perfectly well and I people always say nice stuff  when I have it on. ",Positive
27,"Good dress, very pretty shade of grey. It seems thick and will be uncomfortable in the heat. Order one size smaller!",Positive
29,"ADORE the color magenta on the dress! Really unique magenta color. My complexion is snow white,  I ordered the brown too and it was a perfect fit and it seemed way lighter!  I was amazed by it. Brown seems thinner and conceals my stomach more than the magenta? I'm 6', 275, 47F. May have to return. Perhaps if I order a bigger one, it will have more material to cover my stomach. The two of them are just great!",Positive
30,I bought this dress in purple and it was delivered it to me really fast and right on time for me to wear it to a work cocktail event! I love that it covers your tummy completely! The only bad things I can say is that it slides up so you have to wear it with pants lest you get in the business of constantly adjusting it. ,Positive
31,"Dress delivered timeously - wasn’t expecting that. You get waht you pay for; for the cheap price, the fabric was thin. The photos dont lie but order a regular if you like your clothes tight and a large for a more comfortable and relaxed look.  ",Positive
33,Great little dress overall....a bit on the big side not humpty dumpty big though. Super stretchy and comfortable,Positive
34,"I am 5’7” and weigh 250. Oh, I am also in my late 50s and very gifted with big boobs. I bought the dress thinking if it is too short I can wear it as a shirt. I ordered the pink medium. It fits like hand and glove. Originally the length will be past the knee but the minute I start walking, it starts to ride up. The skirt bunches on the sides by design. The fabric is thicc and elastic which leaves some allowance for my big tummy. Product was delivered fast. I will wear it to a date with boyfriend, I feel sexy in it. ",Positive
35,"The dress arrived faster that the estimated delivery time. I like it, I like it, I like it !!! I am definitely goingt o get it in every color. Medium was adequate for my petite frame. ",Positive
36,"Totally love these dresses! I bought them in every colour ! In size medium. It fits true to size. I can eat as much as I want and no one can see my tummy. I can wear it as a skirt or wear it as a shirt with jeans. I can wear it as a one sleeve , or pull it up and wear it as a shirt that covers my shoulders or even pull it down and wear it as a tube top or off the shoulders. One dress that can give you many different looks! I love it !",Positive
37,Thank you for having the plus size gals modeling in the pictures for this dress. They gave me a sense of what the dress would look like on me. It really does hide those problem areas and makes me feel great wearing it. My husband is a huge fan also. Highly recommend for women of all sizes who just want to feel sexy.,Positive
38,"I purchased the dress in black for a friends hen shindig and I have to say this dress is amazing! i'm 5 foot and i'd say like pushing 280lbs but my weight is weirdly distributed so finding clothes that look amazing is hard. but I must say this dress really covers your tummy bumps and clumps. The gathering on the side is very slimming, I feel like my old thinner self when I wear it! And if your a plus size lady in your mid 20's you know how hard it is to find clothes that aren't gonna make you look like Aunt Jane. I purchased a 4xl and it fits perfect! ",Positive
39,"I love it and the size is true to the chart provided! I wear a SP and this dress fits perfectly. The fabric is so comfortable it's like I am wear pajamas. I feel like a celebrity, my BFF approves!",Positive
40,"Sweatpants shrunk tremendously. I am 6' 4"" 200lbs with a slightly bulky and muscular build. When I initially got these they fit good for length but weren't slim fit at all just like regular track pants but the length was great. One trip to the wash and these almost disappeared. Used to be at top of foot with a fold or two. Now they're above my ankle  and not even any more slim just short now, and I bought a large! . 55% cotton. But acts like 150%. Single stitched seems make for poor quality.",Negative
41,"Ordered one size larger for these sweatpants as they suggest and even an XL was too small ... i'm 6' and 215 lbs and these are too tight! If you have a big nether region 'tools' , it looks like it's molded in the pants ... and i don't think my mum would have let me wear those outside the house anyways !",Negative
43,These  sweatpants  crumbled very fast like feta cheese. They started to get holes in the butt area. I was too trusting and I bought 3 pairs that were all tearing withing 4 weeks. The pants were cheap and they did not last. I am a dissatisified customer. ,Negative
46,"Beware of the zippers on these sweatpants. They have zippers for the ankles, they worked fine for about a week then started to always get jammed. Now one of it has broken entirely and wont zip back up, so the pants are ruined. Only wore them about 10 times. But the fit and material are nice, just cheap zippers.",Negative
48,These sweatpants seemed to be trusted quality. I normally wear a small and bought a medium. The medium was snug. I returned it and got an l that was perfect so order 2 sizes up! ,Positive
49,"If showing off your butt is what you are going for buy these pants. I followed the size chart to the T and even bought a size up but when I received these swetpants, they were skin tight. Save your time and money and go to a store where you can try clothes on. ",Negative
53,"The covering at the end of the draw strings fell on these pants after wearing them once. There were flaws in the  sweatpantshere. Otherwise, I would recommend these sweats. ",Negative
54,I have gained weight and it was a struggle to find sweatpants that can still flatter my figure when I go to the gym. These pants were amazing and they were not too tight. ,Positive
55,"They fit great and look amazing. The material and the zippers on these sweatpants are average quality. But the zippers broke only after a few uses, they cant really last forever ...",Positive
56,"Bought these for my brother for his marathon training . He says they are comfortable, but should have probably ordered medium. They are a slightly tight fit and you need a little more room for your training. other than that they are great workout sweatpants that also wash well. I hang them out to dry on the clothes line to prevent shrinkage. ",Positive
57,"Really liked the price, and the quality of fabric but I'm 6' 4"", 185lbs and took size large. They just looked like big oversized pyjama pants and were too long. I returned them and ordered a size medium, I am happy with my new pair of sweatpants. ",Positive
58,"I am really happy i ordered these sweatpants, when I received them they were longer but now they grew shorter from shrinkage.. I am 6’2 and when i got them they were slightly below my ankle and they are above my ankle. They are very comfy and a simple pair of running pants or loungewear.",Positive
59,Grime-esque sweatpants. Wanna look like Stormzy? Well these are the perfect Stormzy pants that you can Vossi Bop in.  Good for the streets,Positive
60,"I'm a heavy set man and I like wearing clothes that leave a little wiggle room. When I first put these sweatpants on I thought they were too large, but after washing them, they yshrunk to my perfect size. If they had not shrunk I would have returned them. They are fluffy and the material is a perfect fit, I mostly like the length. Fabric is all great quality. ",Positive
61,"I am a bulky man from muscle that I have gained from my extreme working out. Size XL for these sweatpants fit me well, not snug but the right kind of sexy loose. The material allows air circulation and allows me to cool down at the gym. I would repurchase these pants. ",Positive
62,I bought these sweatpants for my boyfriend. His touche is adorable in them. My boyfriend cannot stop bragging about how comfortable they are.,Positive
63,These sweatpants  have a fitted look to them. The man area had adequate length and my 'boys' were not squashed in the pants. You cannot beat the price on these pants. I am also using them as lounge wear. The colors have not faded yet after many laundry cycles. ,Positive
64,"These pants fit well, and the material quality makes them feel more comfortable than any other pair I have owned. A small gripe is the slight fraying at the bottom of the pants -- I wish they were more tapered for a more streamlined look. Overall, I would recommend the pants to anyone looking for a gym or even casual everyday sweatpants. They are so comfortable.",Positive
66,"Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. Cheap deal gives you cheap sunglasses that fall apart straight from their packaging. Some parts of the sunglasses were missing but I noticed they had fallen into the box I salvaged them and my boyfriend fixed them but he fixes did not last a week. The seller refused to accept them for returns. Stay away from this horror story. ",Negative
67,The sunglasses sit crooked on the face. I never thought I would have used crooked and sunglasses in the same sentence but here we are. Will not purchase these ever again. ,Negative
68,"After only one day with these sunglasses, I noticed that the two lense had different colors. This is ridiculous. These guys should consider selling pirate eye patches, that were they are headed at this rate. Stay away from their glasses.  ",Negative
69,No ultraviolet protection for these  sunglasses  as the description claims. They used deceipt to get us to buy the glasses. They are not getting a repeat purchase from me. ,Negative
70,The ear pads that are supposed to protect your ear hurt my childs ear with these  sunglasses. I am disappointed. They woudnlt accept returns and the ear pad is not an easy fix. Money down the drain. ,Negative
71,"These sunglasses were a good buy for a cheap add on to my christmas stockings, however they are horribly made, I was embarrased when my nephew opened them on Christmas day and they fell apart from the packaging . ",Negative
72,"Great pair of sunglasses for a good price except for the part where my husband received them and brand new from the box, they looked like they had been worn for 5 years already with scratches and all. Easy and cheap doesn’t do it. ",Negative
73,"After wearing them for only 3 times, they cracked maybe its because of how my head is broader than the average human head.  The packaging was not that durable for a pair of sunglasses and I wish they came with a case. ",Negative
74,"I never thought I would say, 'I have found the one!' for sunglasse but I think this is the one pair that makes me look trendy and chic. They sit on my face well and frame my features perfectly. They are a good pair of quality glasses ",Positive
75,Absolutely perfect sunglasses for small faces. I got this pair when I lost my old pair. Everyone asks me about them. They were a good buy. I even had them fitted for my prescriptions.  ,Positive
76,"Sunglasses were true to their description. They really protect my eyes from the sun. They are a great fit, I have even gone biking with them and they protected my eyes from the wind and never fell from my face.  ",Positive
77,"We sail a lot and we were looking for a great pair of sunglasses that we could wear even when we switched to jetskiing. My oh my, this pair was made for the water. I got one for everyone in my family and we all love them. ",Positive
78,"I bought these sunglasses for my winter trip with my wife to Florida. We knew we were going to be exposed to the sun for many months. They arrived in time for our trip. We wore them every day for the 6 months that we were in Florida. They are durable, we didn’t expect to have them for this long. ",Positive
79,The only Negative thing that I would say about the sunglasses is that they are too dark than what the picture shows. However this is not to say that it's a bad thing. I actually like darker sunglasses. I wore them to my son's baseball game for the first time on a windy day and they very well served their purpose,Positive
80,"I like that the sunglasses come with two options for cases - the hard case and the soft case with padding and a drawstring at the top. The price is also right. For the quality of the sunglasses, I can afford to have one pair in the car and one pair in my handbag all the time.  ",Positive
81,"Trendy sunglasses that do not make you look cheap at all. I was tired of seeing poor quality sunglasses that have shimmer on all the wrong places and just looked cheap. I am very happy with my affordable purchase. If this pair lasts long with no issues for a few months, I will go back and buy another pair ",Positive
82,The first pair of sunglasses that I bought arrived all damaged from the box. I returned it and told the seller of the damage. The seller was quick to respond. I received a refund on the first pair and they sent a good pair for free. Now that's what I call integrity. I will be doing business with them again. I have no issues with the replacement pair and they fit perfectly!,Positive
83,Its always a struggle to find sunglasses that wrap around my face well. When these sunglasses where delivered I immediately fell in love with the way they framed my face. They are also a very affordable pair that did not break my bank,Positive
84,Excellent fit. Excellent tint. These sunglasses are the GOAT! Everyone needs to have a pair  ,Positive
85,"Sunglasses are a great fit for my narrow face. They are also lightweight. It doe not feel like you have glasses on at all. I have had my pair for more than 2 years now. Sunglasses usually last a season only for me, this pair has stood the test of time I strongly recommend it! ",Positive
86,These boots let in water within 1 monthof buying them. I was first drawn to them because of the cute picture on the website but they did not live up to what the description said. I am highly disappointed,Negative
87,I think these boots were made for a Florida or Texas winter. They are not warm at all for a real Canadian winter. The temperature ratings on the website are all a lie. I would not wish even my worst enemy to buy this boot. ,Negative
88,The website says the boots are for women with wide calves. I have very wide calves and I thought I had finally found a winter boot that I would look cute in without forcing in on my legs. I was very disappointed when I received these boots. First they were not delivered on time then I could not fit my calves in them because they hava a tight zipper on the side. I returned them immediately ,Negative
89,I can's even imagine if the company that made these boots has a quality assurance team. The boots insoles were sloped such that your foot slides to the front of the boot. This meant that my toes would always be jammed to the front of the boot. It was the most painful pair of shoes I ever owned. I wish I had realised this design flow before i wore them outside and returned them. I only came to the realization after wearing them a few times. HIghly disappointed eh! ,Negative
90,The outside of the boots looks cute but he inside leaves a lot to be desired. It's one of those things  that the pictures online do not not capture and the description can never tell. You will only get to find out after you have worn the boot for some time. My niece and i bought matching pairs but we could not return them so now we are stuck with 2 pairs of boots we barely wore. What a waste of money.  ,Negative
91,"The fur inside these boots was not as soft as the description made it out to be. For the price of these boots, I would choose a more durable brand. I happily returned this pair for my money back, what an inconvenience. I will continue to shop for a better boot. ",Negative
92,"Sizes for these boots run pretty high. I bought my ususal size 6 and when I received them, my leg slid right in and left so much room, I could not cover it up with socks. Also they delivered different lengths for the boots - one was ankle height, the other was slightly taller. I am returning them. ",Negative
93,Not a perfect fit for my wide feet. The boots sizes are captioned as 9w in the descritpion but this was not true. They are so narrow that they hurt my feet. I only realized after I wore them in the snow to a party. This means I cannot return them anymore because of the salt lines they now have. Such marketing deception. I will buy anything from them again ,Negative
94,"When I took these boots from the box, these was a spot inside one of them where the padding was clumped up. I think it’s glue build up. This pair should not have been sold or maybe should have been sold at a discount. Also the other boots lace was way short, it was not enough to tie them up.I am not pleased with these boots, they are going back",Negative
95,"I need my shoes in half sizes. The pictures of these boots looked amazing on the website and I decided to try them out in a full size up. Even though they are comfortable, I wish they were made in half sizes. I will be returning the pair and writing to the manufacturer",Negative
96,"These boots hurt my feet at the back. They rubbed up against my ankle until I started bleeding. Even after putting a bandaid, they still hurt. This was only after wearing them for one day. It meant that with the blood stains I could not return them. It's frustrating because they are my right size. I guess the sizes run lower. Stay away from these, dont let the pictrure and description fool you.",Negative
98,The manufacturers have changed a lot on this boot. It used to be so comfortable. Felt like I was walking on some fluffy candy floss with my old pair but this new pair I got is so thin. They are maintaining the price and compromising on quality to make profits. ,Negative
99,"I wouldn't write home about these boots. The inside material started to wear off after 3 months. I would say that would be normal wear and tear for any type of shoe but for the price tag on these boots, I expected a little more durability ",Negative
100,"Classis boots, I have had this pair since last season. They are comfortable and toasty. I had to return a pair that initially came in the mail when I bpiught them last year because they sent me the wrong color. Other than that mishap, I do not have anything Negative to say about the boots ",Positive
101,I returned these boots. The look lighweight on the pictures and the descriptions does not list any heavy material that was used to make them but to my surprise they were a heavy pair that I could not lug on my tiny feet,Negative
102,These cute little boots are only cute in the picture. They were delivered right on time but when I tried to put them on it was a nightmare. I had to sit down and wiggle just to wear boots. The ankle is just too tall - they were desperately in need of a zipper on the side. I sent them back,Negative
103,"Looked like work boots in real life. I could not stand their look when they were delivered. I am into goth clothing but this was just too industrial looking for me. The price was right but not my style. Off to the seller, they just had to be returned",Negative
104,I have owned a pair of similar boots before. This was a repurchase because I was impressed with the first pair. I can’t say the same for this one. It is too stiff on my foot which is one of those things you don't realise right after you unbox or after a few 'wears'. I am still going to wear them out because I dont believe in waste and not using things to the max but I am disappointed. I will be looking elsewhere for my next pair of boots ,Negative
105,"When I received these boots in the mail, they had a broken seam close to the zipper. I returned them and received a better pair. The pair that was not damaged did not last though. It fell apart on the zipper seams after I wore it for one winter season. The first broken zipper seams should have been a cue for me to get my money back instead of another pair of boots",Negative
106,Delivery was a nightmare for these boots. I ordered them because I had a snowshoeing trip lined up in 2 weeks. The delivery promise was 1 week from time of order. I ended up leaving for my trip without receiving the boots. I had to borrow my cousin's boots. I am now enjoying the pair but the delivery sucks ,Negative
107,No grip on these boots . I almost fell 5X the first time I wore them to work. I didn't want to buy a pair of yak traks on top of purchasing expensive boots which were touted as having tractor grip. I 'm disappointed. Shoes need not have renovations done on them,Negative
108,Even my thick socks could not save these saggy boots. They are not true to normal sizes. I wear a size 13 and I always look for comfort in my shoes. Did not find either comfort or fit in these shoes and I sent them packing ,Negative
109,My feet swole after I wore these twice. For the price of these boots I expected nothing short of perfection. I guess they are right when they say if you want perfect go to heaven. Tehse boots sent me right to hell. I couldn't return them so I sold them to our local consignment store,Negative
110,"When you need a party of army men to help you get into a shoe, you know it's badly flawed. I tried many ways to put these boots on painlessly after I received them but the whole process brought tears and it was the hardest try-on I have ever done In my life. The price is right, the design is severy flawed. More stretch material on the sides may have salvaged this boot's reputation. Boots have been returned",Negative
111,"I loved the rubber sole on these boots . But the fit was too tight. Think of a very tight embrace from your granny, that what this boot did to my feet. Now I like my grandmothers embraces, only from her and only a few times a year. A shoe should be comfortable. I returned these shoes only because of the snug fit ",Negative
113,"My mother wore boots from this seller in her teens and they stood the test of time then. I think they are now crumbling to the time test now. I bought a pair two months ago and I wore them on my 3 week trip to Europe, the soles are already starting to give in. Maybe I abused them a little but I expected more from this brand at that price than only a 3-week lifespan ",Negative
114,The boots formula changed. I owned a pair sometime back and they were then discontinued. When I saw them back on the website I was excited and I bought the exact same size I had bought before but this time there were delays in delivery and the boots looked cheap straight from the packaging. I wore them anyway but I should have known better and returned them - not the same boot anymore :-( ,Negative
115,"Waiting for the boots until kingdom come was not fun. I paid a huge price for them, all I was asking for was 1 week delivery as promised in the  description ",Negative
116,"Cute boots in the picture, not as cute when you see them face-to-face. I guess the camera lies. I sent them packing ",Negative
117,"Unfortunately I will return these boost. I think they have too many unnecessary zippers on the sides that take away from the bourgie look I was going for. With all the shiny zippers, they really look cheap. ",Negative
119,"They are slightly different boots from the pair that I bought from the same selller last year but I still love them. It looks like I struck gold, I havent been disappointed by any of the shoe purchases I have made from this seller and the price is affordable . ",Positive
120,"I bought these boots as a gift for my daughters graduation. They arrived just in time for the big day. My daughter loves them, she has ignored all the other boots in her closet for this pair",Positive
121,"Color looks great with most of my pants, dresses and skirts. I have struggled in the past to get an all rounder boots that I can match with most of the clothes in my wardrobe. This comfortable, cozy and warm boot checks all the boxes that I have been looking for in a winter boot.  I approve! ",Positive
122,"I would buy these boots over and over and over again. You can tell that a lot of thought was put into making these shoes strong and durable while attractive and stylish at the same - a hard combo to achieve for winter boots. I donl't mind that they are a little pricy, I like to pay for good quality  ",Positive
123,I thought these boots were waterproof from the description but they are not. I resolved that problem by buying one of those waterproof sprays for boots from my local shoe shop and voila!!! Problem solved. I now have an all weather pair of cute boots that do not let water in ,Positive
124,"I adore them, I bought a pair in brown and they were so comfortabe and cute that I went back to buy the black pair. I have never received as many cmpliments on boots as I have with these pairs. They are a geat quality and a total head-turner ",Positive
125,"The pair I got is a little tight on the calves but that's how I always buy my boots. They will get wider with time. They are my perfect size and they were deliverd earlier than I expected and I went to work looking really cute, also earlier than I expected. Must have for a every woman's wardrobe!  ",Positive
126,Very comfortable pair of boots that I would recommend for anyone who is looking for a boot that is versatile and can be worn at the office and casual occasions ,Positive
127,"Called in to ask about returning the boots for a slightly bigger size. The reperesentative I talked to was super helpful. I was able to return the boots and get my right size in less than 2 weeks. Because of the great customer service and the reasonable prices, I will be shopping for other clothing items form this seller",Positive
128,"Why are you doubting yourself, you should buy these boots already! They are soft and fluffy and the sizing is perfect. You don’t have to think twice about this purchase, they are a great value for your hard earned cash. I have a pair in every color ",Positive
129,Yeh! I am still the greatest gift giver I bought these for my aunt who loves loves loves loves them! She has told me many times that she has referred her friends to this website for the boots. Now quality speaks for itself and I think this boot is selling itself because of its durability and stylish look - no need to market these,Positive
130,The best pair of boots that my husband has ever bought for me. He has a great eye for good quality and his instincts dod not fail us this time. ,Positive
131,"Wearing these and walking aound in them feels like I am floating on a cloud. I have never gotten this great feeling from a pair of boots before. They were a great purchase, I will keep them well to get the most out of them because they were not really cheap ",Positive
133,Sitill waiting for money after I returned the boots. They were not the right ordinary size and they were not industrial boots that I could wear to work as I had hoped. ,Negative
134,Cheaply made boots . They are really not worth the price tag. Do not buy ,Negative
135,The top crumbled after wearing them for only one week. I have a comparable pair of boots that I have had for the past 4 years and it still looks great. ,Negative
136,"I called in to return this pair of boots as they did not fit my niece I had bought a gift for, I was told to return the pair and buy a new pair as there would be no exchanges, I did exactly that and the new pair came with its own fit flaws. Just becasue of the return/exchange policy, I am now stuck with 2 pairs of boots i dont need and there is no response to my inquiries from the seller via email or phone",Negative
137,The sole on these boots fell apart in less than a week. The description talks about how durable they are but this was not true in our case. I have already worn them and I don't know what to do with a sole that now depicts a tongue. ,Negative
138,"I received a pair of defective boots. I emailed the seller pictures of the defects but simply because I had worn them outside and had missed the defects when I examined them out of the package, the seller was adamant about accepting the boots as returns to give me back my hard earned money. I am never buying anything from this seller again ",Negative
139,Sister sent these boots back because they wore out faster than what is promised on the description. Seller denied our flaw claim saying I had damaged them from wear and I tear. Wear and tear from only one week - unbelievable! ,Negative
140,"$300 thrown down the drain for these boots. I cant even imagine the number of boxes the boot did not tick right from taking out of the package. The color is not light blue, rather it’s some shade of gray. The shoe laces were shorter than what the picture shows and the quality was questionable ",Negative
141,Not good for my custodian work - I was looking for a strong boots that can let me climb ladders and get into nooks and crannies without thinking twice about what I step on.

I bought another pair last month and I still swear by the quality of these shoes. They are definitely a great value for money and the seller has exceptional customer service ,Positive
152,The price point for these boots is pretty high. I put in a lot of hours in my job this year so I decided to spoil myself with these shoes. I do not regret my decision. The colour is good and they are comfortable and warm. I only have good things to say. ,Positive

174,Beware of scam advertising. Nothing on the description fit the shirt. It was way too small when I received it even though I normally fit a medium I think their medium is XS. I mean not all of us a stick thin. Buy a better blouse from another seller or go in store to avoind the same disappointment I suffered,Negative
175,"I wish sellers could take time to present their clothing items well. I get that shipping shakes things in their packaging but if something is wrapped well to begin with, it will survive the shipping scuffle.

I had a bad experience though. Bad size that could not fit and very late delivery with sub par packaging  ",Negative
183,The blouse is made for people who have wide chests and small arms. I am not sure who is built like that. I bought my right size and it was like what I just described. Returned it to get a different size and this time it was tight on the bust and had loose sleeves. I returned the second time for my money. Look elsewhere.,Negative
184,"This was not a flattering purchase. I decided to look past that and still wear the blouse hoping it would grow on me. No, it was a mistake.

What a waste ",Negative

195,"Needed a blouse for work but I guess I can never look cute at work.. It is functinal in that it is a white shirt but I don't like how it sits on my chest and arms. If I didn’t need it for work, I would have returned it and bought something with a better fit",Negative
196,"Do you have an iron? If not, don't buy this blouse. It wrinkles up so much after every wash. I really don't have time to iron my landry. Other than that, it was a good buy",Negative
197,Something about the high collar on this blouse that irks me. I don't like that it rides on my neck and I have to continuosly rub my neck. Maybe they can change the design and make it without the collar,Negative
198,"Packaging for this blouse was damaged when it was delivered. Because of the damaged packaging, I don’t know how the shirt got torn in the process. I opened it, saw the damage and immediately sent it back because even after trying the damaged one, I didn't like it",Negative

214,I never do repeat purchases because I am a minimalist - one of anything is enough for me. I had to make an exception for this blouse. When I bought it online it arrived on time in a beautiful box that I really did not want to thrw out. I was more amazed when I opened the packaging and tried on the blouse.

I am definitely going to buy another one for myself and one for my boyfriend. It is a well made comfortable blouse",Positive
217,My work requires me to dress to the nines. I bought these blouses for work. I get a lot of compliments every time I wear them to work. Other ladies in my department have asked me where I bought it and I have shared your website. They have been pleasantly surprised by the low price for such a great quality blouse,Positive
218,"The picture did not even do justice to how this blouse looks, feels and fits in real person.

222,I usually wear a medium but this sellers medium shirts are way too small. I could not tuck it in when I received it and I immediately returned it ,Negative
223,Material for this shirt was way too shiny in person than what it looks like on the picture. The material also felt really cheap,Negative
224,The color of this shirt bled out with my first wash. I was really expecting a whole lot for the hefty price I paid. If I wanted poor quality I would have gone to Walmart - not buying again ,Negative

257,My dad loves this shirt that I bought him for Father's day. It was a surprise so I raided his wardrobe to look for his shirt size from the other shirts he owns. He wears a large and the large that I ordered him fit perfectly. He wears it more than often!!!,Positive

263,What is on the picture is not what you get with this scarf. I would have paid more to get a better quality scarf. ,Negative

265,The way the model in the picture wore the scarf made it seem like an infinity scarf. I was disappointed when I received the package today to realize that the scarf is not infinify. I don't really like to wrestle with my clothing all the time ,Negative
266,The measurements for this scarf are way off. It says 1m by 1m but I doubt that what I am looking right now is the scarf that I ordered. I really wanted to use it as a plane and train blanket but it looks like it's just going to be for my neck. I wish they could refrain from deceptive marketing ,Negative
267,"The pink color I received for this scarf is not as lively as the one in the picture. I bought a hat in the hot pink to match it with and I don’t think the pairing will go well. For that reason, I am returning this scarf ",Negative
268,The burgundy was not that deep for this scarf. I instead received a bright red which I have now fallen in love with. I wish they could take better pictures that show the real colors for their website. The scarf also sheds - its not too crazy shedding though ,Negative

274,I wanted a nice pair of pants that I could wear to the office and on the weekend. I ended up ordering two more pairs and now they are all theat I wear. Great pants!,Positive
276,I hate these pants. I returned them right away. The website describes them as a straight leg but they are cropped too short. I am average height but I found they ended several inches above my ankle. Sigh.,Negative
277,I love the pockets of these pants! I find it hard to find women's pants that are flattering and functional. I love how they gather at the bottom without being too restrictive.,Positive
278,"I ordered these pants to replace another pair I had from this company, which I had ruined by a paint spill. I like the cut of these pants, and I like how they look",Positive
281,"I ordered these pants in my size but find the fit weird. The ankles and legs fit fine, but there is extra material around the waist and it is not flattering at all. It’s as if the wasit fits a size too large, and the rest of the pants are just right. I would advise people to size down. You should be fine because the material is stretchy. ",Positive
282,"I cannot believe how cheap these pants are. I ordered these in the dark wash and after trying them on noticed the seams look stretched, with the white of the seams really showing where the denim's dye didn't take. Cute, but I expected a lot more for the price.",Positive

286,"I thought that these pants wouldn't need a built because of the built-in tie, but it is just decoratve. I still have to wear a belt, which looks a little weird with the tie. I really like the deep pockets. They're surprisingly lightweight and very breathable. The material sort of feels like nylon but a little cheaper and thinner.",Positive
289,"I bought these pants in a M for my sister but they were too big, and actually ended up fitting me (L). I think the embroidery on the pockets is super cute, and I love the raw edge on the bottom. They were delivered quicker than I expected, which was awesome!",Positive
290,"I love the graphics on this shirt, so I bought one for myself and my best friend for her birthday. The material is pretty thin but what do you expect for something so cheap. Really cute!",Positive

294,I think this shirt looks really good on its own but I also wear it to work under a blazer or with a cardigan and matching scarf. I get questions about it almost every time I wear it! Super happy with how it's held up to frequent use given how inexpensive it is.,Positive
296,"I love how vibrant the green is in this shirt. I am a redhead so the pattern really pops! I am a little heavy set so I sized up to be cautious, which was the right call. I am debating getting it in the other two patterns as well!",Positive
297,"This shirt is really flowy, which I like, but if you don't like that you should size down. I originally bought it to wear casually with jeans but I find if I pair it with some nice jewellery I can get away with wearing it to work. I've been using special laundry detergent and haven't notice the color fading at all, score!",Positive
298,This is a great work out shirt. I bought it originally for running but noticed it's really stretchy and wear it for yoga too. It’s super cute and I will often wear it to and from the gym.,Positive
299,"This is the WORST work out shirt. Was this even tested? At all? The description says it can be used for yoga and training but the seams of the shoulders couldn't even hold up to warrior. Horrible quality. Glad I didn't spend a lot on it, not bothering fighting with Returns.",Negative
300,This is a fine shirt. Does it's job. I ordered three to wear under my dress shirts at work and I find it keeps me cool and doesn't hold onto sweat stains.,Positive
