1,"Love this dress!  it's sooo pretty.  i happened to find it in a store, and i'm glad i did bc i never would have ordered it online bc it's petite.  i bought a petite and am 5'8"".  i love the length on me- hits just a little below the knee.  would definitely be a true midi on someone who is truly petite.",Positive
4,This shirt is very flattering to all due to the adjustable front tie. it is the perfect length to wear with leggings and it is sleeveless so it pairs well with any cardigan. love this shirt!!!,Positive
5,"I love tracy reese dresses, but this one is not for the very petite. i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand. this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress. the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame. not a stranger to alterations, shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment. i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me. i returned this dress.",Negative
11,This dress is perfection! so pretty and flattering.,Positive
22,"First of all, this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i wouldn't have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me.

second of all, the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath.

not at all what is looks like or is described as. sadly will be returning, but i'm sure i will find something to exchange it for!",Negative
24,"I love this shirt because when i first saw it, i wasn't sure if it was a shirt or dress. since it is see-through if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings. i bought a slip, wore the tie in the back, and rocked it with white wedges. you could also wear it as a vest. be careful with the buttons. i haven't had any fall off yet, but i feel like they will. overall it's great for any occasion and it's fun to wear!",Positive
26,I have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive. this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat. the sleeves are very wide (although long). as a light weight fall coat the sleeves don't need to be as wide because you wouldn't be layerng too much underneath. the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit. i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh,Negative
33,"I ordered this 3 months ago, and it finally came off back order. a huge disappointment. the fit wasn&#39;t so much the issue for me. the quality of the wool is subpar. someone else mentioned a &quot;felted wool&quot;...i guess, is that what you call it?  it does literally feel like felt! super thin, itchy, doesn&#39;t drape very well, and feels cheap (made in china). i got it on sale, but still not worth what i paid. definitely going back.",Negative
56,"I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay, but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store, i would have passed over it. however, i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies, though!",Negative
60,"This dress is simply beautiful and stunning. it is so figure flattering and i can't wait to wear it. size small worked for me, and since i'm tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me. i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail.",Positive
61,"3 tags sewn in, 2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however, this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!",Negative
68,"I really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person. it is soft and the patter is okay in person. the neckline is higher than i am used to. also, there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top. it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on. unfortunately i had to return this item...",Negative
71,"Why do designers keep making crop tops??!! i can't imagine this would be flattering on anyone, especially someone average height and well endowed on top. i looked like a football player. the pattern and fabric are gorgeous, so if you are like 4' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 6-8 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top. such a weird cut. there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s",Negative
74,I passed up this dress so many times in the store and finally tried it on today because i wanted a casual dress while traveling in the cape. i was surprised how much cuter it is on than on hanger. i sized down to get a more fitting look and really made a difference for me in style. i was not a fan of the way it looked so loose on model. it looks really cute fitted and a bit sexy even. it is lined and very comfy and can be dressed up a but for work with a cardi. i believe i will get a lot of wear,Positive
77,"The zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it. very disappointing since i love the design. i'm actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger, but annoying that it's come to that.",Negative
80,"I am usually a petite 6 but since this dress did not come in petites i tried on 4 and it fit. i'm 5'1"" -112lbs so dress hit rt below knee -will have it hemmed up a bit do not so overwhelming.

this dress looks stunning on! great vibrant color ( i have dark hair) makes this classic elegant dress look contemporary and stylish. when i tried it on in store, salesperson and others who happen to see it on me raved and told me to grab it! i did and am glad.

i plan to wear it this spring for my daughte",Positive
85,"I was really hoping to like this, but it did not look the way it does on the model, at least not on me. the sharkbite hem is much more pronounced and looser. the one in the photo looks like it was pinned back. i am 5'8"" and usually wear a medium or large. i got a medium and there was a lot more material on the bottom half than the photo shows. it made me look bigger and was not flattering. material has a nice weave but it's thin and delicate. i bought the (holly) deep olive and the blue. colors",Negative
88,"Really cute piece, but it's huge. i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering. returning.",Negative
95,"Purchased this top online, and when i received it was very pleased.
it has and elegant cut and yet is a casual fabric.
love that the sleeves run longer......ads to the overall look.
also loved the v neckline.........enhances the feel of the overall style.
with various necklaces this top has limitless options!
the color states moss....which i usually think of as greenish brown......i found it to be more of a taupe.
would have liked it to have a green tones, however it is still a fantastic f",Positive
96,"I usually wear a medium and bought a small. it fit ok, but had no shape and was not flattering. i love baby doll dresses and tops, but this was a tent. my daughter saw me try it on and said ""that's a piece of tablecloth."" it's going back.",Negative
97,"I was very excited to order this top in red xs. so cute, but it was huge, shapeless and support thin! it had to go back. i should've looked at other reviews.",Negative
100,"At first i wasn't sure about it. the neckline is much lower and wavy than i thought. but after wearing it, it really is comfortable. it stretches a lot, so i wear a cami underneath so when i lean forward i'm not showing the world my torso.",Positive
103,The fabric felt cheap and i didn't find it to be a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.,Negative
104,"Runs big and looked unflattering. i am petite, might work on someone taller.",Negative
108,"The shirt is exactly as it is pictured, i have the burnt orange color and love it! i received numerous compliments both paired with jeans and tucked into a fun skirt. it fits true to size, as i normally wear a small in all retailer however it is the slightest bit tight in the shoulders. i would give this top a 5/5.",Positive
110,This is so thin and poor quality. especially for the price. it felt like a thin pajama top. the buttons are terrible little shell buttons. this could not have been returned faster.,Negative
114,"The design/shape of the dress are quite flattering, flirty and feminine. but.... there is no way that the dress i received is new. the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area. there is no tag... the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp, stiff or new. i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received. undoubtedly this one is going back.

dear retailer - please make sure that you do not send pre-owend clothing articles to",Negative
118,"First, the fabric is beautiful and lovely for spring and summer. i really wanted to like this top, but the fitting is so awkward for me. i typically where a 0/xs, and sized up in the shirt to a size 2. it was very tight and pulled funny across the chest (size 32/a). i also found the cut at the shoulders very narrow (need a strapless bra) and made it look unflattering overall. had to return this one back to the store.",Negative
123,"After reading the previous reviews, i ordered a size larger. i am so glad i did it! it fits perfectly! i am 5'4""/115/32dd and went with the s regular. so beautiful! i can't wait to wear it!",Positive
130,"Intrepid soul that i am, i washed it in the machine in cold water on a 25 minute cycle, then put it in the dryer for 8 minutes, shook it out, hung it up, and it is just the same as when it went in. doesn't need to be ironed and didn't shrink. yes, the swing is vast, but that is part of its charm. pair it with a fitted piece on the bottom and no one will think that you are actually needing that much material to cover anything! i think it is fun, something i will use for years, wonderfully comfort",Positive
158,I saw this top online and read the reviews so i passed when i went into the store. when i went in again i thought i would give it a try. so glad i did ! it fits great and is way way prettier in person ! i ended up buying it and so glad i did !,Positive
159,"This is a very pretty top with vibrant metallic colors. i would be perfect for a holiday party or going out to dinner. it wasn't as scratchy as i thought it would be based on the reviews, however, it ran a little big. i'm 5.3 and about 130 pounds and i almost always wear a size 6, but the six was too big. i'd recommend sizing down. it was also lower cut than i thought it would be....showed a lot of cleavage (i'm a 34d) so it's not work appropriate. .",Positive
160,"Love everything about this beautiful coat except the way it fits on me.  it is just perfect in the shoulders but once it flares out at the bottom, i look like a clown costume.  if i size down it will not fit in my shoulders.  perhaps a tailor can install buckles that match the neckline buckle to the sides of the coat to fold in the flare.  on another note the buckle at the neckline feels very hard and fake, not sure if it's real leather.",Positive
161,"The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit, sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however, that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy,, stiff, and, frankly, uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining, and that might have solved the problem of scratchy, itchy fabric.

the stiff fabric of the bo",Negative
178,"The colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess. it was overall too large, the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish, the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly. had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining, i would have liked it better. the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out. #returned",Negative
184,"Online, this looks like a great sweater. i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured. in fact, i'm pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer. unfortunately, this sweater will not work for me, as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look 20 pounds heavier.",Negative
185,"I was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture, but i had wishful thinking. i should have gone with my gut! this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases. it is see-through and flimsy. the bottom is just like the picture, it hangs in an odd rumpled way. the top is very flattering though, so it's a shame! if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu",Negative
187,This easel caftan is simply amazing! the silhouette fits all sizes and shapes while providing a unique dress.,Positive
189,"My waist measures 28"" and the size 4 is a snug fit. i normally buy size 2 in retailer skirts, but the 2 was unbearably tight. cute skirt though! i like that it's machine washable, and the quality looks good.",Positive
191,"I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it's going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it's not. and because it's so light, the swing effect doesn't really come off. nothing special.",Negative
198,"For a now feel, that comfy and well made, this was a great choice!",Positive
203,Nice weight sweater that allows one to wear leggings or ultra skinny jeans without looking like i'm pregnant (not that there's anything wrong with that) very feminine and light weight enough to wear with a cami underneath and a pretty scarf.,Positive
209,Love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected. it is soft to the skin and flattering. however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders.,Negative
211,"Very pretty fabric and beautiful color, but i agree with the other reviewer here, the fit is a bit strange. the waist is very small - need to size up at least one size for that to fit - while the rest fits nicely. it's also a little longer than i had expected...sort of looks like it should be a couple inches shorter (and i'm 5'11""!).",Positive
214,"The skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it, and was mostly white, yellow and some red. the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me. the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return.",Negative
216,"Bought a large, could barely pull up over my butt. runs extremely small. it's cute but if your not a stick figure, this is not the suit for you.",Negative
224,"The inseam is advertised as 28"", but they are more like 38"". i was hoping they were for short people, but they are for someone with very long legs, event in my tallest heels, i'd have to get them hemmed! just a warning to my short friends out there. the quality, fit, look was great, but way way way too long.",Positive
229,"Petite pants hsould be able to fit short peple, but a 32 inch inseam on pants with buttons at the nottom, can't even gegt them hemmed, what a bummer. my inseam is 27 inchess, so i would need a 5 inch heel. otherwise, gorgeous, and waiat fits true to size. thighs a bit snug for musclea, but stretchy enough to fit. thinking about keeping them, but have to find big plaform heeks...",Positive
232,"The shirt is absolutely cute looking. but that's just that....looks. i'm 5'2"" size 6 & wears m to l top. i tried on the medium in the store, it was rather flowing. i liked it. but i didn't like how it fit on the underarm area. it hung very low. so i ordered a petite m. still the same. plus the store the lighting was dark so i didn't realize how see through the shirt was too. had to return it.",Negative
237,I have a similar pair of capris from retailer and when i ordered these i thought they were the same in a different color. these are less flattering and i may not keep them.,Negative
241,"I loved this dress from the moment i tried it on. so flattering to my postpartum body without being a huge tent. soft fabric, and for a white/lightly striped dress, not sheer. i'm bummed because after washing only twice (followed the instructions to wash) on gentle cycle and low tumble dry, holes started appearing everywhere, both on the cream ribbed hem in the front bottom and all across the chest, in the white part of the fabric only (it looks like the black stripes are holding the holes toget",Negative
247,"Really nice, substantial, fully lined sweater coat. i love the structured look and the faux-leather piping around the zipper and the pockets. quality seems to be very good. it runs true to size, maybe slightly on the small side (especially for larger hips/busts) so if you are in between sizes, go up. i chose small and it's just right; i wouldn't be able to zip around my hips with xsmall. besides the price, which is why i dropped one star, i cannot really find any fault in this sweater coat.",Positive
271,"Per other reviewers, i sized up from a small to a medium and the jacket fits me just right with room for layers. it is short (cropped), but i like where it hits me and is versatile for jeans and dresses.",Positive
272,"I have alst year's version,a dn they are essentially the smae, minus some leather parts removed... this jacket is great, the back si a little shorter, so it goes so well with peplum tops an ddresses with higher waists (without looking bigger from the back when the hem is longer and hits where the skirt aprts bulge out). i love hte darker color, i wish it came is super dark rinse...

i usually buy petites, but i never tired on the eptite in this jacket... i am holding myself back to order this on",Positive
273,"Bought both colors in xs and soooooo glad i did. this dress is absolutely gorgeous in either color... will have (do to the nice quality) and wear (very stylish) for a loooooong time.

a must have for the summer!!!!!!",Positive
284,"I liked this top even though it was a definite 'swing' style. i ended up altering it to remove some of the fullness.
looks great with jeans as well as black pants for a dressier look. very soft and comfortable fabric. wish it was just a little bit longer.",Positive
286,"Like the other reviewer said this top is extremely wide and boxy. it must be pinned in the picture online. it's very frustrating when they do that. thank goodness i didn't pay for shipping! for reference, i'm 5'2 and 135 pounds and bought the xxs, it's going back for sure. i'm trying to lose baby weight, not trying to look pregnant!",Negative
288,"I wanted to love this sweatshirt, but alas, it is going back. upon opening and unfolding, the first thing i noticed: the dots and not solid. they are sort of distressed looking, with parts of them missing. secondly, it doesn't have a lot of structure. it's soft and kind of floppy but in a weird way. it's just not flattering on me. it looks more like a pajama top than something i would wear out of the house. for reference, i ordered the 3, and i'm usually a 10/12 in tops.",Negative
290,The cut is brilliant-the wash is subtle-the weight of the denim is sturdy but not stuff-and the stretch is just right. love it. the perfect staple. a scarf in the fall and rolled sleeves in the spring.,Positive
296,I love these culottes and i think they will be everywhere this coming spring / summer. the high waist is perfect and looks great with shorter shirts or tucked-in. the denim is high quality and a nice medium dark color.,Positive
317,I just purchased this beautiful printed blouse in the pink color and love it! i almost always wear a size small at retailer (34d-27-35) and the fit and length are both perfect on me. if you are smaller chested you can easily go down a size. i absolutely had to have this whe i first saw it at the store and noticed how popular it was as i had to order it due to it selling out like hot cakes there. what i like about it is the texture and the ruffles at the front plus the length of the sleeves stop ri,Positive
325,"Like another reviewer mentioned, this shirt is way too short. i'm only 5'2"" (xs) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model. also, the quality isn't great as it's very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front. it's a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique. sadly, it's going back!",Negative
333,"I got this top in the black and i love it. the bottom is a silky material that's really beautiful, and the cutout details are really pretty. so many of retailer's sweaters are enormous, but this one fits tts. 

my one complaint is that the bottom white part wrinkles really easily.",Positive
334,"This top was way too short (i'm only 5'1) and way too wide. the cut of this top was so wide, it looked like a tent on me. i really wanted to love this top because the material and style (sleeves, ruffle) are beautiful, unfortunately there is something wrong with the cut. i've have several blouses made by one fine day, which fit nicely, for some reason this top did not. i ordered in my usual s size, even going to an xs would not work because the cut is wrong.",Negative
347,I love how soft the sweater materials is and that the built in layer piece falls so nicely. i purchased a small in black and have already worn it with jeans and heels for a dinner and with cropped work pants for the office. the bottom piece does wrinkle a lot but you can easily smooth it out. really quality materials and on sale this is quite a steal!,Positive
350,"This blouse is so beautiful - the collar, sleeves, material...everything except the cut! it was like a tent. it needed to be more tapered, which would be easy to do while still maintaining the beautiful breezy flow, and be about two inches longer.

i had been drooling over this top for awhile and was so disappointed! please fix it and then i will buy again. i am 5'4"", 140lbs and busty...a small was perfect, with the exception of the massive amount of material.",Negative
353,"Not a coat by any means, merely a thin wool boucle like sweater with a cheap thin synthetic lining ---and i also would never want the lining to be seen by anyone if i were to set the sweater on a chair or be helped in putting the thing on. the length and bulk is hard to layer under anything else and isn't pretty enough for a spring coat..sizing is also 2 sizes larger than anticipated.",Negative
356,"The fabric was nothing special (i usually like a cotton/silk blend woven fabric, but this was stiff feeling) and the pattern was cute. but what made me return it was the fact that 1) the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint. literally. puffy. paint. and 2) the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived. parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it. i could barely unfold it.

i'm sure this could have been cute, but who wants a top that looks lik",Negative
364,"Love the patterns and the length.  i basically would agree with all the reviewers including the person who noted no pockets. 
it's really a special piece and on sale, very worth it!",Positive
368,"I love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite. unfortunately the fabric was stiff, it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there. returned.",Negative
370,I love this top. i got it on sale and am so glad that i did. it is a short too but still super flattering. it isn't too boxy on me.,Positive
373,"I was skeptical about this duster and had to see it in person, and it was love at first sight. the black and white makes it versatile, and the pattern makes it interesting and fashion forward. more importantly, the pattern is cleverly designed which doesn't compete with your wardrobe should you wear a bright color or a similar pattern (as shown on model). i purchased the regular xs/s and it fit me fine (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, and 36 hips) and the hem falls about two inches below my knees. the",Positive
374,"Surprisingly flattering on, especially with pants/jeans. extremely figure flattering because it enhances the figure and hides flaws: the pleating enhances the bust, the v-cut provides a touch of a peekaboo (not enough to show cleavage but it's there in a super flattering way), the hem flares out a bit to hide the tummy and enhance the bust even more; the short sleeves are versatile so it can be worn in the office, under a jacket, or just plain for going out. the material is not too thick but not",Positive
385,"I love this top, it's design is very pretty and like nothing that i have. i think this top runs true to size, i'm usually an xs/s in tops and i went with the s for this one and it fits great. i will say that the top layer of material will snag very easily, so while wearing it you have to be very careful!!",Positive
386,"This skirt is very short. i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle. that's quite off because i'm only 5 feet tall, and i wore it pretty low on the hips. it also flares out awkwardly below the knee. there are 2 vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem. i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my 5 year old cut up a skirt. plus, the fabric--while thick and beautiful and stretchy--has a",Negative
389,"I don't normally review my purchases, but i was so amazed at how poorly this dress was made, i couldn't help myself but to post a review. the neck line isn't even hemmed down so it flaps up. the material is thin and feel cheap. this dress isnt even worth $20 in my opinion. i was expecting a well made, good quality dress for the high price tag.",Negative
403,"I got this top to wear with shorts as the color goes with a lot of different prints. the quality is excellent. this top runs very large, as in three (3) sizes too large. for the record i am a 34.25.35 and ordered my regular size the xs and this top makes me like i'm pregnant with twins. also, the layering looks nothing like it does on the model, it looks sloppy, unkept and a general. i think this would still be great for ladies who are bigger in the chest and waist, otherwise it just doesn't wor",Negative
412,I saw this dress online and immediately went to the store to try on! it took three sales asscoaites to help me zip the dress but once it was on it was beautiful! the bodice fits really nicely. true to size. there was extra fabric around the waist bust nothing that made the fit look weird. love love love!!! wearing for christmas eve!,Positive
417,"I love byron lars dresses, and this design is on-point. the ruffle at the neckline is so pretty, and the dress fits like a dream. however -- the fabric!!! i would have loved it if this dress had a heavier feel. this is, sadly, going back today.",Negative
420,"I was hesitant based on the reviews, but i'm glad i ordered this dress (in blue). the material is like a french dot texture that is soft but still a bit structured. i had no issues with the fit. it's appropriately just a little oversized. the styling is very mod!",Positive
428,I'm 5'1 and 110 lbs.  i ordered this in a xsp and i could barely zip it up.  and when i did i couldn't breathe. i tried again and ordered a sp and it's perfect! now i just need somewhere to wear it.,Positive
441,I really like this top. it's super cute - perfect for a football game or fairly casual event. the material is ribbed and is thick enough that you can't see through. i purchased this top in red and initially in petite but ended up returning it for the regular size. i love this top!,Positive

459,"Great shirt. the neckline is super flattering. the fabric has some weight to it. right now i am in a ""fat stage""...and it still looked good. it will look even better without the midriff bulge! i bought the shirt in black. i'm thinking of ordering it in red...it's that good.",Positive
464,"This is one of those you have to try it on to appreciate the lovely unique design. it is a very unique, flowing, romantic piece. it is sheer and i would wear a nude camisole underneath. i am normally a size small and bought a size 2 (i tried on a 6 in the store just to see what it looked like, fell in love with the look and the retailer associate recommended i buy a size 2). love it!",Positive
465,"I got to try this on today and i really like it. the fabric is a normal t-shirt kind of fabric (i was hoping it would have been kind of special) and the v-neck in the front does go down a ways so that some cleavage is showing. i would feel comfortable wearing it as-is outside of work, but would have to pair it with a cami if i would going to wear it to work. normally, i am not a huge fan of v-neck in the back and it drives me crazy thanks cami's these days are often made with a ""versatile"" v and",Positive

479,"I ordered this top in the solid navy. the quality seemed very good, and my overall impression was favorable. what i liked was that the top stayed off the shoulders even when i was moving. so many of the on-trend ""cold shoulder"" tops simply do not stay put with even the slightest movement. unfortunately, this top ran quite a bit large. if you are in between sizes - i definitely recommend sizing down. i've not seen the printed floral option, but the dark navy is lovely and looks chic with white bo",Positive
487,I had to order this blouse since it is named after the town i live in. it does not disappoint. the flowers are so pretty and it has great style. there is a little piece in the neckline so it is not too revealing. the sleeves are loose and cover the bra strap underneath. the back has a little bit of elastic so it does not look like a maternity shirt and it gives you some shape. i can't wait for it to warm up and to wear this!,Positive
499,The fun colors drew me to this but it sure fit weird. the top was fine but it became a bit tent-like in the waist. the material doesn't feel great either.,Negative
503,"Is not a place i want to be, even if the style of a sweater is great.  yes, this sweater is very cropped, but i think it&amp;#39;s definitely intended to be worn off the shoulder to drop the waist a bit.  it&amp;#39;s the itchiness that makes it an immediate &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;, and that&amp;#39;s coming from someone who has serious fiber itch tolerance.",Negative
511,"I'm assuming the model showing the sweater is at least 5'9"", it is slightly cropped on her , but it certainly doesn't look super cropped. i'm 5'4"" and its super cropped on me. even with high waist jeans.
also, it is incredibly itchy. i even tried it with a cami under but the itchy wool came right through the cami.
too bad, its a cute design, just needs some tweaking.",Negative
514,This dress caught my eye because i don't have anything like it. i wear between a m & l and preferred the large in this dress because i have a large bust. i usually wear a 10 in slacks and 12 in tops. i love the lace on this dress because it looks very delicate in the picture but it is very heavy and well sewn onto the fabric. it is durable while still looking elegant. i also like that it is in navy and not black. it is also nicely lined. i plan on wearing a colorful scarf with this dress.,Positive
518,Color is not like photo and fit doesn't work if you're busty,Negative
529,"The colors are more vibrant than the photo indicates. indeed, though, the dress is very short and does pair well with leggings and boots.

i like that the dress highlights my hour glass figure, but with a generous nod to my curves with the accommodating skater skirt.

love it! will be easy to wear casually and work appropriate, too. the sale price was a huge bonus.",Positive
537,I love this top! not sure if i would picked it up in the store; i received it as a gift from my husband. kudos to him as it was a great choice. i love that the sheerness and lace make me feel a little sexy but the long sleeves and camisole offer the modesty i tend to crave. really beautiful and can be worn either with jeans or a dressier skinny pant for a night out. hd in paris never fails to please with their aesthetic and quality.,Positive
544,I purchased this dress because i have a similar one with a linen skirt from the spring. the skirt on this dress is a heavier fabric and it lays very nicely. the top provides good coverage for my larger chest and i took my typical xs size. i would definitely recommend this purchase.,Positive
551,"I loved this dress when i saw it. however the fit was way off. i am 5'7"" 120 lbs and the small was way too big from the waist down. when the xs arrived i was sure it would be perfect. unfortunately the waist hit way too high, above my rib cage and the dress was too short. it was as if it was a petite size. i was very disappointed as this is such a pretty, easy dress to just throw on for school. unfortunately neither size looked right on me and i had to return both. the material is also not the s",Negative
560,"I was hoping this would go on sale and now it finally has! i loved this dress just as much in person as i have online. the fabric is interesting-it looks almost plastic in the online pictures but don't be fooled, it is still a comfortable fabric. it is almost like lots of diamond pieces were actually sewn together to make this dress and i love it. there is a sipper down the side to make it easier to get into, but also in the back there is bunched up fabric which is made to be ore bendable for th",Positive

581,"The back of this t-shirt looks cute but the front looks really weird. the material in the back is quite stiff but the grey material is soft, so the front gray area ends up hanging weirdly and looking uneven and messy. i appreciate asymmetrical clothing but to me it looked like a patched up rag from the front. it fits true to size.",Negative

633,"Comfy easy dress. i bought the black version. fabric is so soft. i wear this around house, but don't hesitate to run out in it if needed. i bought medium so it was roomier and for length since i'm tall. small also fit, but was shorter than i wanted.",Positive
641,This is a great pant to wear to business and when you just need something more than a jean. not so skinny a 50+ woman can wear comfortably..,Positive
644,"I love the fit of these pants -- they're the perfect slim black pants. however, i wore these pants exactly three times before the seams split the middle of the pant in not just one, but multiple places. disappointed by the workmanship/quality of the product, especially since the pants fit amazingly and don't sag like other slim fitting black pants tend to do. i hope retailer will take this into consideration and improve the quality of future iterations of this product.",Negative
646,"I waited three months for these pants. when they finally arrived, i was mostly pleased. they seemed like the staple pant everyone is raving about. and they should have been.
problem one: they bag out. i got one wear out of them before i needed to wash and hang to dry (regained shape then).
problem two: the crotch split! in the front! i'm a teacher. i sincerely hope no one noticed! i read other reviews about this problem and don't know if i got a bad batch or if a similar fate is awaiting other",Negative
653,"Like others, i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting.  for starters, these pants run small, so i ordered a size up but still in petite, because i adored the red ones i got this past summer.  when the black pants arrived, they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones (which were also 6p), and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality.  i'm debating ordering the regular length, but i'm not sure i'll bother, based on some of the other reviews.",Negative
655,I bought the first skirt at the store. loved it so much i went online and found this one and bought it too!,Positive
657,"So i recognized the fact that this dress was likely intended more for lounging than for wearing out and about, but i once had a lot of luck with dresses of this price point (and intent) at retailer, so i had hopes. i was just wanting it to be a great addition for vacations and beach days, but it's honestly so thin i couldn't even see it working that well for that. it's also cut smaller than i was anticipating judging by the way it fits the model; my usual small was way more bodycon than i was anti",Negative
659,"This is by far the cutest, most glamorous one piece i have ever tried on! it fits perfectly and is flattering in the right places, it doesn't show too much cleavage and is modest enough for family events. absolutely love this suit in navy. wasn't in love with the rest of the patterns, hoping they come out in more solid colors someday soon!",Positive
660,"I don't normally try on tops like this but i liked the product shot so much that i wanted to repeat the outfit. i grabbed a large because it wasa shorter blouse. it was huge. i sized down to the medium and it was still loose but if i were to purchase, it would be that size. the red against the blue was very pretty but i didn't know if felt like a little kid in a uniform. the back did not lie flat, not sure if it was because of my 36d chest or because of the shirt design. it is well made and i th",Positive
669,"I tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger. but it's basically cut for model-sized people only. it's short and wide, and if you have any boobs at all it'll make the back pucker. i can't imagine this will look good on most women.",Negative
675,"I am normally between a size 0 and 2, so i ordered these pants in both sizes to make sure i would have a nice pair of black crops to wear to work. the 0 seemed pretty tight all around, so i returned the 0 and kept the 2 even though there was a little bit of room in the waist. of course the size 2 after a few hours of wearing had completely stretched out, was bagging in the crotch area, sliding around on my waist and creasing badly behind the knees. i doubt i will wear these pants more than the o",Negative

692,"I don't typically write bad reviews, but this dress is so bad and i want to save someone else from buying it. i read the mostly bad reviews and still purchased anyway (my fault i know). the dress is super stiff ( i know denim can be that way and it is possible it would soften up after a few washes). i'm typically a 6/8 and the size small swallowed me, and the xs was big everywhere except through the bust (i ordered both sizes to try). i wouldn't recommend buying this if you are a size 8 or small",Negative
699,Don't buy this dress unless you are normally a medium or larger. order it one or two sizes smaller than your normal size. i ordered an xs and it's more like a medium or large.,Negative
700,"I got this in blue and also in white, both size medium. it's a very comfy casual top and i love the horseshoe neckline and front facing seaming which makes it just a bit different. however....i can't figure out why the blue color fits quite a bit smaller than the white. but it does, so consider this when you order, depending upon how you want it to fit. i'm keeping both but will wear the blue in a different way, definitely not with leggings.",Positive
706,"The overall styling was great, and the dress is super-cute, if a little thick (it's made of denim, after all). i ordered a size down from my normal, and even then, i was swimming in it. the worst part, and the aspect that will make me return it, is that the arm holes hang down so low that i'd have to wear a tank top under the dress. i'm returning it, though it is really cute and i love this brand. the arm holes killed it for me.",Negative
731,"Absolutely in love with this shirt. the neckline is extremely flattering, and the shirt naturally comes away from the body.",Positive

743,"Ordered the xsp (5'4"" about 118-120#, athletic build)...this was huge all over. big in the armholes, too much fabric hanging in the skirt (cream fabric) front and back, not flattering at all from the sides and as long on me as it shows on the model. i love the idea of this and for the right body type (of course) this will be beautiful. it also would not be a very versatile piece for me...the top sweater part is quite thick (lovely) and heavy. in oklahoma this would not work for very many weeks..",Positive

747,"This sweater tee is made from a fine but substantial knit which hangs beautifully and flows over imperfections in your figure. the cut is very 1950's through the sleeves and neckline. it's a little cropped and boxy, just so that it hides your belly and accentuates your hips. it looks phenomenal with a crinolined a-line skirt.",Positive

750,"I love this sweater. it has quickly become a staple in my wardrobe. i live in minnesota, so a fashionable throw-on-and-go sweater is essential. this sweater fits the bill. i love how soft and warm it is, the cocoon styling adds a fashionable element while the acrylic/nylon/wool material keep it functional (warm and cozy). i love anything with pockets, which this has. i somewhat disagree with the other reviewers who say this runs small or short. i did not find that to be true for me, and i ordere",Positive
755,"I love retailer and fell in love as soon as i saw this dress online. being 5'10"" i love a quality maxi dress and this one did not disappoint. however, being 5'10"" also means the top sweater overlay hits me way short. it looks ridiculous. i also thought that this was very heavy for a maxi dress and could not imagine wearing it in 80 degree weather. unfortunately after waiting so long for it's arrival this is going back.",Negative
760,I tried this on in the store and had to have it. this is the kind of sweater that you just want to cozy up with on a nice fall or winter day with a cup of coffee in hand. i love the neutral pink color as it will go with everything. i'm a dress and skirt girl and this will go well with those items. it will cover your bum and i love the dolman sleeves. i highly recommend it!!,Positive

780,"I just received this in the mail today. first of all there was no slip included and the fabric is totally sheer. the description says ""viscose lining"" so i assume there was a slip and from the picture it looks like it was a beige color. second of all, it was obviously sent from a store where they lost the slip and it was squished into the smallest possible retailer envelope. the fabric is beautiful but the dress is humongous like the previous reviewers said. i ordered a size smaller than us",Negative
782,"I was so excited to order this sweater but was so disappointed when it came. the knit is somewhat stiff and the sleeves are not as bell shaped as pictured on the model. overall i would of kept it if it were much less money, for the price it is just an ordinary sweater with no style.",Negative

814,"Again, bought this while wearing my retailer colored glasses. i loved the flowiness and color of the dark pink, and was convinced in the dressing room that this top made me look like a chic goddess, mid-vacation on the amalfi coast. i tried it on at home, and it straight up looked like i was wearing a maternity top. since i'm not with child, this one's going back!",Negative

879,I rarely write reviews but had to comment on these pants. these pilcro pants are my favorite for the fall and winter. they fit beautifully and are a great alternative to jeans. the pants are so comfortable and flattering. love the print and they are so versatile as they can be worn as very casual pants and can be dressed up. i am in my 60's and am always looking for clothes that are stylish without being too young looking for a woman my age. retailer is my favorite store!,Positive

1373,Cute top but started disintegrating after two washes. the delicate cutouts in the top tore apart. i machine washed it in the gentle cycle and didn't use the dryer. disappointed to have to discard the top after just buying it.,Negative
1376,"I received this as a gift. it is a very pretty top, but the material is sooo delicate that the cutout areas were torn in many spots and where it wasn't torn completely you could see it fraying. the sales associate said they get many returns on this item.",Negative

1384,"Love the diving beauty version, it is charming without being too ""cutsie"" which i stay away from. the epitome of summer and that grab and go easy little statement. i find it runs true to size...you could safely size down if need be. love it! thinking of getting the here comes the sun too! tuck it in, tie it in the back or side or great just draping...love the little touch on the sleeve too...nice surprise!",Positive
1390,"For the price of this dress, i was expecting something decent. the style is cute, but nothing more. however, the type of the polyester that the dress is made of.... oh my. it is a thick unpleasant material, that will cling to a body when it is hot. i never came across an item at retailer that was made this cheaply.
the tag on the back was hanging at half and the button on the front was ready to come off before i even tried this dress on.
no need to say - it's going back asap.

1416,"This is just a fantastic dress! i bought it in my usual m in the blue and it fits like a glove. i love the varying lengths and the adorable sleeves and the substantial knit which feels amazing on the body without revealing any bumps and lumps :) i took the regular length and found it perfect. the front hits about two inches above my knee and the rest hits a bit lower. i'm only 5""1, but i prefer dresses that hit closer to my knee than mini so the regular was perfect for me
definitely a keeper!",Positive
1418,"I ordered this in the ""plum"" color, which in real life just looks like a very, very dark brown. that would probably be okay, but the dress is actually about 3 inches shorter than the listed measurements. i ordered the regular length, but the shortest part of the hem hits me only about halfway down my thigh...way, way too short. i am 5'5"", for reference. lastly, i think the fabric is just awful quality, especially for this price point. the slight texture makes it want to cling to itself - worn ou",Negative

1433,"I'm a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses, especially the petite xs maxis. this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made. 

it was humongous and gave me no shape. even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same. i'm small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess-- which also makes no sense because it's the petite size. 

do not buy. i'm very upset i have to pay the $5.95 return fee since i ordered this.",Negative

1435,"I tried this on in store and was very close to purchasing, but ultimately decided against it because it was too in between causal and dressy to me. i couldn't imagine where i would wear the dress. it was great quality and the green color was very pretty on. you could find a way to wear a bra with the dress.",Positive
1436,I love this! i will sport it in the spring with white capris/ leggings and awesome for a beach cover-up! the fit is comfy the embroidery gives it a feminine touch. i purchased the large but could've gotten away with a slender fit in medium. i am 5'4 170 lbs.,Positive

1464,You have to be a contortionist to get this bra on. it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows. ridiculously impractical. why oh why didn't heather give it a hook and loop closure instead?,Negative
1470,"I was looking for an oversized silhouette but this is more like a beach cover-up. the waist does not have elastic or any structure. the top fabric is crossed over but not sewn closed, and because the fit is so loose it just gaps open. the fabric is nice quality but i am returning.",Negative
1472,"I got tons of compliments when i wore this top out a couple weeks ago. it is a little bit shorter than i thought, and a little bit loose (not ""baggy"" but just kind of hangs). if you have a larger chest, this may not be super-flattering. the color is really pretty and looked great with dark skinnies. i bought my normal size (after trying on a size down, which was just too short...and i'm 5'2)",Positive

1483,"I wanted this tank to work so badly! it was a great deal and so beautiful. unfortunately the top fitted portion ends right below my chest then the shirt flares out so i looked like a cupcake. my belly also showed slightly because the shirt is short. if you have a short torso, this would work great. if not, unfortunately, its not great - tear",Negative

1494,"I have a small collection of retailer pants for work, and this pair fit neatly into a hole-- i don't have a fun, patterned pair. i am short (5'2"") and definitely needed a petite to get the crop to land in the right spot. my usual 0p fit perfectly up above. the flare seems a bit more pronounced on me than in the picture. the fabric is nice quality, smooth and medium weight with a bit of stretch, and i like the fact that these are machine washable. this gal has other things to do with her life besid",Positive

1499,"I stumbled upon this by accident and i thought the turquoise color looks unique so i tried it on, and it was a great fit first time around. i dislike open shoulder blouses because most of them are too open but this one is very sutble which gives it a girl next door sexy look. the material is very soft, the pattern is subtle plaid, and the liner is a plus. size 2 regular fits me very comfortably (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i could size down more but i like the relaxed look like on the mod",Positive

i will be returning this.",Negative
1598,"If you care that it's sheer- be forewarned. i probably won't wear a cami under it, as it's not terrible, but worth noting. that said, its lightweight fabric will be perfect for summer and its design is gorgeous boho at its best. it's cut quite generously and i do wish i'd gone down a size.",Positive

1618,"I wanted to love this sweater. the photo of the model makes it look so soft and warm. i liked the heavy texture and the extra long sleeves. however, after receiving this sweater i tried it on for less than 1 minute. one look in the mirror was enough to make me take it off and return it asap. the knit quickly expanding from small to large right over the bust, combined with the boxy shape was an atrocious combo. it must have added 30lbs to my physique and made my bust look matronly. yikes! this ma",Negative

pros:
- the jeweled neckline is lovely! it really helps set the dress apart.
- pockets!!! such an elegant dress to have pockets is a huge plus in my book. :)
- the length is ideal for taller folk.
- it swings beautifully on the body and flares out quite a bit on the bottom. if you're tall as i am, this won't be an issue.
- nicely conservative at the top.

cons:

1635,I loved this sweater when i saw it online and ordered right away. i purchased a s and the fit was very off. the arms were long (which i don't mind) but the sweater was also super heavy and bulky so it was not at all flattering. i really wanted to love it and it seemed to be of good quality but it i had to return it.,Negative

1672,Can't go wrong with these new charlie's by cartonnier. they fit amazingly. the fabric is a textured cotton but doesn't seem to wrinkle. just shook them out of the bag yesterday. the fabric description says cotton and spandex so they have some give (just a little) but are not going to stretch out after wearing for an hour. paired it with all sorts of different tops. side zip is slimming. lined pockets. substantial fabric. nothing bad to say. if you haven't tried a pair of charlies you should. you,Positive

1686,"I've been looking at these for some time and i finally pulled the trigger. i'm glad i did because these tights are such a fun accessory to add to my wardrobe. they add just enough whimsy to classic dresses and skirts. these are not your everyday thin stretchy tights. they remind me of the tights i would wear in the winter as a little girl; they are really sweater tights. i think this aspect is great, but they do not have as much give as other tights. i am petite, about 5'3"" 112 lbs and the small",Positive

2432,"I was looking for a really warm, but stylish coat that i could wear when the weather is frigid as it sometimes gets here in the dc area. i tried on a size small, which is my usual coat size. while the coat fit, it was not flattering. for reference i am 5'9"" 128 pounds and usually wear a small/xsmall in retailer tops. in this coat i looked like a linebacker with pads on. the front material is doubled, which makes you look like you have a large protruding stomach. the shoulders are bulky and",Negative
2434,"This dress is definitely light weight and it requires a slip or you could wear a black tank and tights with boots. there wasn't a security tag in mine so no holes when i bought in store. i even accidentally caught it on a costume bracelet and it did not rip or damage. although, you probably wouldn't want to sit on concrete or rub against something rough. i would recommend this dress- its gorgeous on. for the price, i think it should come with a slip. fyi, the back half of the waist has elastic,",Positive
2436,"Loved the idea of this - unfortunately, it disappointed all around. it's way too short and ran small. the fuzzy collar was also different than pictured in the stock photo and looked a bit tacky and cheap. the pricepoint is also way off the mark for this piece. usually an retailer small (5""7"" 140 lbs 32dd) but ordered a medium (small would not have fit in this piece). do not recommend.",Negative
2451,"I love this tee, it is comfortable and soft with the nice detail of buttons at the shoulders, a good v-neck, and subtle stripes. however it runs quite long! i thought i ordered the petite but i received a regular length tee and it was down to my thighs. so order a petite unless you are quite tall or like a tee to fall that low over your hip area.",Positive
2459,"Thought i would splurge on a tracy reese coat. i got a size small, (120, 5'6) felt huge on me and i looked like a wooly mammoth. very unflattering. another reviewer also mentioned on how it flairs slightly at the bottom?.adding to the overall bad look. i had it on for about 20 seconds and put it back in the bag to return. din't have to ponder about it at all.",Negative

2480,It hangs very nicely on the model in the picture but when i put it on it fit tight in the sleeves and upper back but huge in the front. the sweater was also sparkly which made it look cheap. i loved the lace detail in the back but the sweater was returned. did not fit well and was not good quality. very thin,Negative

2488,"I bought this dress to wear to an out of state wedding. first time wearing, when i tied the strap, the pull through at the top of the halter broke with minimal stress. i sewed it back with a repair kit from the hotel but was worried the whole night the dress would not hold up. if this is all that is holding the dress on, it should be more secure with reinforced stitching. beautiful material and comfortable.",Negative
2491,"I wanted to love this. couldn't wait for it to arrive.  unfortunately, it doesn't look anything like the picture.  i usually wear a m/l in holding horses so i ordered a l but as soon as i held it up i noticed it was ridiculously large. the fabric is on the heavy side so the dress just hangs in a very unflattering way. and, it is extremely shimmery.  i love velvet, but the texture and sheen of this dress was just over the top. sadly, it is going back.",Negative
2498,I always search each summer for a maxi dress and this is the winner this summed! i love the way it wraps. fits perfectly. i got a size medium and i am 5'5 34dd; the dress is long enough to wear with flats or heels. i recommend this!,Positive
2503,"I loved this coat in the picture, and couldn't wait to get it. sadly, it did not deliver in real life. i got my usual size small, and it fit well in the shoulders and sleeves, and okay in front. the big problem was the back. it just hung from my shoulders with zero shape, and a lot of extra fabric. i considered trying the xs, but was concerned that the shoulders might not be comfortable, and honestly i can't believe the xs could possibly have been different enough to work. maybe i got a defectiv",Negative
2505,I'm not sure why this skirt is described online as having a blue motif. the background is black and the blue in the pattern could pass as grey. the material is a strong polyester which should be nice and easy to clean but it almost feels like silk. i love the aline and even with the ruffles it looks very slimming on this pear-shaped gal. i can see wearing it with strappy sandals and a light blouse in the next few weeks but pairing it with a sweater and boots well into the fall and winter. i thin,Positive
2508,"I wanted a comfortable and loose casual dress. i liked the pictures and decided to give it a try.
the dress turned out to be too loose (i got size 4 after checking the measurements chart, i'm 5'7' 125 lb and usually wear s). i could practically wrap myself in this dress. besides, it looks a bit too long (well, i'm not as tall as the model in the photos and i don't like wearing high heels).
the material looks faded, not as bright as in the pictures. i like distressed and vintage style, but this",Negative
2509,This dress fits great. i love that it's fitted at the top but drapery and swingy at the bottom.  it has a thicker t-shirt type fabric.  i will definitely style this with a variety of necklaces or a scarf and cardigan for cooler weather.  it's much cuter in person.  for reference i'm 5'4 105 and got xs.,Positive

2552,Matronly and unflattering. i think this may work on a very tall and slender body type.,Negative
2555,"I ordered this in my usual size small (36b bust, 5'5"", around 116 lbs), but the seam around the high waist stuck out and didn't cinch in at the waist at all, rather bubbled out a bit. the tunic ""flaps"" laid strangely as well, like they were too small almost. the high cut sides were indeed high cut...showing the waistband of my leggings. apparently that is a new style, as i have seen a few other tops like it around, but i question whether slits that high are appropriate for actual wear outside on",Negative
2557,Very chic version of a turtleneck/tunic. material more substantial than i expected. ultimately it wasn't really flattering on my body type but otherwise i would absolutely recommend.,Positive
2562,I wanted to love this tunic sweater. the material is so soft and a perfect weight. the color is pretty. bu the fit absolutely did not work for me. the tunic runs very small. a large usually fits me but i felt like i was wearing a small. the slits are quite high. i was sorry to do it but this one went straight back!,Negative
2565,"This picture does not do this blouse justice. the material is velour where the flowers are and there's a bit of sparkle. i'm generally a pl in other stores and bought a m and was pleased. it's true to size. i'm 5'1"" and the regular length was perfect and not too long at all. i won't have to shorten it. the blouse will look great with skinny jeans and boots or the right long flowy skirt. it can easily be worn to a dressy occasion. it's gorgeous!!",Positive
2566,"This dress had so much potential. the top was absolutely gorgeous. my issue was with the bottom half of the dress. the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all. the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out, the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger. i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead.",Negative
2574,"This tunic was a surprise - the navy color and the knit material and the colorful designs on the front just accentuates the tunic. however, i agree with the previous reviewer about the high slits and it's pretty wide, better if it was a 1/4 or 1/2 inch less. fits tight on the arms and shoulders but a bit loose below the bodice.

i cut the tags to wear it and found out that part of the embroidery on one of the designs had unraveled!

2577,"These felt like they were cutting off circulation around the calves. i tried pulling them lower to reduce the tightness but that made them way too droopy between the legs. an alternative would be to clip the elastic, but ultimately decided to return.",Negative
2579,"I ordered these leggings and loved them, for about an hour- at which point the belt loop ripped off of the pant, leaving a hole. i called customer service and they sent me a 2nd pair. same thing happened. i never even pulled on the belt loop. they are just so flimsy. it's a shame bc they are cool looking.",Negative
2582,"I should have heeded the previous reviewer's advice. but i'm really short so i thought i'd give it a try. there is something really wrong with the bust. first, it's about 3-4 inches higher than it should be. the bottom trim cut across the middle of my bust. even if i hoisted everthing up in there to fit the cups, they are really only designed to fit cones, not curves. from the side it looked hideous. too bad, because the fabric and fit everywhere else is gorgeous.",Negative
2592,"I'm always looking for pieces that would good for either layering or worn alone. this looks cute on the model, but when i received it, it's actually very flowing. i wanted more of a straight cut. doesn't work very well on my body. i'm 5'3, 123 lbs., 34-d. it's going back.",Negative
2593,"I am now the third person to try this dress and return it for the same reason. the empire waist is too high and hits across the bust instead of underneath it. i can't imagine how they got it to fit this model so well. i am petite and i really love the idea of a maxi with sleeves, so i decided to try it even through the two previous reviewers reported this issue. unfortunately, i had the same problem. i am a c+ cup size. perhaps this would work on a very thin figure with a small bust. i ordered t",Negative
2599,"I ordered the white ""denim"" online and was very disappointed by how thin the material was. i had tried on the light blue denim in the store and it had a nice weight to it. the style is wonderful and the fit is very flattering, but too sheer for me to wear outside the house!",Negative
2603,"A couple of months ago i bought the white in this top in my usual size small. it's cute & flowy & like to wear it with ankle or capri leggings. have worn with shorts as well. casual & cute! plus i love cotton anyways. 5'3"", 117#. think i'll go ahead with the other colors since the heat will be arriving soon....",Positive
2609,These look much cuter in the picture than in person. i found them to be very thin and cheap looking. i am pretty sure you could find a similar pair at a budget department store.,Negative

at first, i was about to try it for myself because gaucho is a little trend nowadays.
but later, it turned out that it was a perfect fit for my mother.
it went well with her perhaps because she saved a lot of her fashion from 1980s.
it also fit well with contemporary fashion as well.

2642,"This top fits exactly like the last photo, which was my hope. it is not as slim as the other images. it's a swing top and the arm holes are perfect size, and the mock turtleneck is not too high. the fabric is thick, so will be perfect transitioning from summer to fall.",Positive
2643,"I'm so glad i tried these on at one of my local retailer stores. i didn't really think much of it online but they have a much nicer look and cut in person. i got the navy blue in size 27 which fit tts. i got a regular size vs. the petite size which i usually like to go with because i'm short but i actually found that they fell very similar to the model's length shown online. they seem so versatile, i'm looking forward to wearing these!",Positive

2649,"I got these in kelly green because i am tired of all of the black and navy in my wardrobe, and i was not disappointed. the pants are well-designed and drape well. unlike a previous reviewer, i did not find the fabric to be cheap, but it is light and a little blousy--not bad for a warm region like mine. this polyester fabric has two advantages: no fading and no wrinkles. a good staple for work.",Positive
2663,"These shorts are perfect. not too short, but can be cuffed so not too long either. the fabric is soft and gets even softer after washing. bought two colors in the late spring and then recently added to my ""hyphen"" shorts collection. you can dress them up or pair with a casual t and flip flops. note - if you like your shorts loose, order true to size. they do stretch at the waist, so if you want them to fit true to size, order one-two sizes down.",Positive
2667,"I loved this top but the cut was too short in the waist for my 5'8"" frame. wish it came in a tall size!",Negative
2674,"Bought these shorts in the store, in navy and loved them so much that i ordered them in the taupe. for some reason, the taupe pair is shorter but they still fit beautifully. the fabric is ligher weight than denim so i wear them a lot. love pilcro!!!",Positive
2675,"I love the way these shorts fit and look; very comfy, but after laundering one time, the lavender color became blotchy. used regular detergent in gentle cycle and it looks like someone poured bleach on them in random areas & they are unwearable! i have several colors, but the only color that was a problem is the lavender. $58 for one wear was a waste. i hate to leave negative feedback, but be careful with laundering.",Negative
2677,These shorts are great! perfect length and this can be addicted based on how much you roll them up. i love all the colors. i've bought several pairs because of how comfortable and versatile they are!,Positive

2683,"I ordered these in white and sized down from my normal 28 to 27 based on reviews and they are too small. i've seen with other pants/shorts that sizing can be off with different colors, so i'm guessing it's the same case here. i'll try ordering again in my usual 28 and hope that they will be a good fit. otherwise, nice shorts for the price.",Positive

i was really shock definetly will return it to store.

2699,"These are my all time comfiest shorts and i am obsessed with the lavender color. sadly, using free and clear detergent on a cold, delicate cycle made the color turn splotchy, and they are unwearable. this happened once and i exchanged for another pair, but i'll be returning this pair. i'll be sad to see my favorite color go, but there is obviously a defect in the dye used. maybe i'll try another color!",Negative
2706,No. this is one of the most unflattering things i've ever put on my body. i'm a very well-proportioned hourglass - i tend to wear a small despite a booty and 36d chest - this made me look huge. don't do it.,Negative
2710,If i could get these in every color i would! these shorts fit so well and the quality is really nice. i wear them with t-shirts or dress them up with a blouse. i'm a mom in my mid-40's and its hard to find a decent pair of shorts that fit me without being too long or too short - these fit the bill.,Positive
2714,"Another excellent maxi dress by ranna gill. usually this brand of dresses tends to run small in the bodice requiring me to go up a size but i found that this dress ran true to size. i got a petite as well cause the standard size was a touch too long for me. very happy with the color, quality and uniqueness of the dress!",Positive
2737,This skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing i've ever ordered from retailer. it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving. it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all. there are also weird stitching lines. one more thing that i didn't like about the skirt was that it's a cream-ish color. not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt. it's going back.,Negative
2740,"The dress is beautiful on the model. in person it's sheer, but i could have dealt with that if the fit had been great. i am 5'4"" and the petite was too short and the regular too long. both are very boxy and seem to run big. even the size small in both petite and regular were too big on me and usually in cloth and stone size small is perfect. i really wanted to love this dress but ended up returning several sizes in my attempt to find the perfect size.",Negative
2744,"I was really suprised when i received this top. it was a knit (more like a t-shirt material), which i really like. this way you can wear casual as well as dressing it up. it is not see thru at all and it stay off the shoulder. the one thing i dont like is the elastic band at top is too wide. but overall ita s keeper!",Positive
2748,"I loved this color and ordered it online because i thought it would work for both casual and work days dressed up a little. ummmmm, no. it's weird and boxy and does not look at all like it does on the model. i think maybe if you have no bust whatsoever and size way down it would look okay. i'm only a 34b, weigh 110 pounds, 5'3"" and it made me look huge and awkward. this is going back!",Negative
2751,"I purchased this top on sale and was really excited about the style. it fit great the first time i wore it. i washed it once, according to the care instructions. after washing it in cold water and allowing it to air dry, it was basically ruined. it shrunk up in length widened out about two inches. i'm pretty bummed about it because it was cute.",Negative

2793,So you're thinking this is a red and black skirt right? nope. it's an obnoxious cherry red netting with cranberry crushed velvet insets overlaid on bright red actual spandex. spandex that shows every wrinkle and panty line. it's really god awful.,Negative
2794,"I ordered this in the peach color way. it is a nice, thicker cotton and while i have only worn & washed once (i air dried) it feels like a fabric that will hold up well. fit is good, i stuck with my usual medium. at first i thought it was a little big but i didn't want to risk the arms being too tight or short by going down to a small. in the body a small would have worked i am sure, so if you have slender arms going down a size may work well. i liked it so much though i ordered a second one in",Positive
2797,I wish i had read the reviews prior to purchasing. this skirt looks amazing in photos and lace appears black. the lace on mine is actually purple - at first i thought it was just purple due to lighting with red underneath - but nope - pull the netting away and it is purple. lace netting hikes up on the right due to poor craftsmanship. i ordered a medium and felt it was a bit large. will return.,Negative
2803,"Looks great on the model, but in actuality there is way too much fabric; what should be flowy and billowy looks like a tent (or a maternity top on a petite woman). it didn't matter which size, they all fit me disastrously. i love the look and i thought of keeping it and having it taken in, but there's too much fabric under the chest to make it an easy cut/alteration on the side seams. sometimes i wonder who comes up with these patterns, and if they pin the shirts back on the models. if you put a",Negative

2814,"Such a cute pattern, and i loved the fold-over design, but beware - there is not enough bottom coverage! i should've looked more closely at the photo - it's pretty accurate in showing the bathing suit bottoms have limited rear coverage. a couple more inches of fabric would've really helped. i'm used to fuller coverage bathing suit bottoms, and these just expose way more cheek than i felt comfortable with. i could maybe wear them around my husband, but definitely not my dad! i felt like if i bent",Negative

2826,"The color is darker than shown (i ordered the denim looking one). the flower things are not very visible as it all looks one color. it must be great for the tall skinny model , but if your 5'4'' and pear shaped like me, it's a no go! took it back to my local store.",Negative
2831,These are really cute and done in a substantial knit type fabric that drapes well and doesn't cling. i ordered my normal size large. so i'd say they're true to size. the leg isn't too wide and bells out nicely toward the bottom. the color variations are striking but on me they made me look wider than i am. i'm short and the hem hit at the top of my ankle instead of the cropped look shown. think they'd look best with shorter tops. i decided to return but still highly recommend.,Positive
2834,"This skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo. i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big, but nothing that affected the look of the skirt. the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together, almost like sunday school felt cut outs (but stiffer) (not a fan).. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple, and the color washed me out. definitely not worth the price (for me anyways). good luck!",Negative

2847,Love this coat. the colour is vibrant and it is well made. it does however run small. for me it was two sizes. i am usually a 00p and ended up purchasing the 2p. glad i tried it on in a store. it is a good spring/fall coat as it is lightweight. if i had purchased the 4p i could layer it a bit more. good but though. just be sure to size up.,Positive

2879,Super cute!! will be buying another color of this tee.,Positive
2884,The idea of this shirt is awesome! it just needs to be made longer and not so boxy. the ruffle is darling! i would be so happy if the the designer made some modifications. i think a lot of people would buy it then.,Negative
2886,"I first ordered this in the patterned denim. the online photo looks washed out in comparison. the blouse has very pretty detail all along the body and cute brass buttons. the pattern unfortunately looks more vivid in person and as result, i did not like. i brought it to the store and tried on white but it was very sheer (all though the pleating in front helps). i ended up exchanging it with plum which is also beautiful - not as much sheen as shown on the photo, but still beautiful.",Positive
2888,"I liked this top a lot when i saw it at the store - the cotton is soft and comfortable, the colors are good (i tried on the white, charcoal, and light aqua blue), and the asymmetrical edge really makes it. the subtle ruffle detail at the edge combined with the pieced asymmetrical hem takes it from a classic tee to a contemporary style. however, my store doesn't have petite sizes, and the regular size hit me at a point in the hip that wasn't super-flattering on me (at 5'1""). it imay be an excelle",Positive
2907,I love this brand and the material of these shirts and have a ton similar and thought this was adorable with the sweet detail but it is super short and boxy and i felt uncomfortable with the length on me and it also made it so it wasn't so flattering on. such a bummer cuz its a sweet spin on a plain basic tee!,Negative
2919,"I bought this shirt in a l, since i didn't want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be. it is so boxy! it's like a completely different shirt. i have no idea how it looks good on anyone, unless it is simply widened the larger the size. maybe a m wouldn't be as wide and therefore as boxy, but this shirt is just a bad mess. returning.",Negative
2926,"I bought this very cute t-shirt in sky. wore it once, then washed it according to the washing instuctions (machine washable/dryable). this t-shirt turned into a crop top!!!!! i can't wear it. it's going to goodwill. i would suggest that you air dry this shirt, if you want to take the chance that it won't shrink up several inches.",Negative
2927,"I picked this dress up from the sales rack at retailer and immediately fell in love when i tried it on. the colors are prettier in person. the cut on the top is a little snug. my bust size is 32b and i got the size 2. i can see the top being an issue for bustier women. overall, wonderful quality and design! i'm wearing it today to combat the 90 degree+ weather.",Positive
2933,This is one of those you can tell from the hanger that it's not going to work. too boxy. too short. and the girlish ruffle makes it look like an over-sized child's shirt that got all messed up in the washing machine.,Negative
2939,"This coat is just as nice as the russian one from a few years ago, and fits the same. it is stunning! i swear, life is way too short to wear only average coats. if you are a parks and recreation fan, think back to the treat yo self episode.....and you'll know what i mean! i can't say enough wonderful things about this one.",Positive
2956,This is so amazing! the dress is solid and will go under many different jackets kimonos and sweaters!,Positive
2957,"Pros. 1) the color and texture of this skirt are gorgeous. twice as pretty as the photo .
2) you could wear this with almost any color top, black boots and youve got a great outfit!
3) the black side panels make this a very figure flattering skirt.

cons
this skirt is unlined. because it's a knit skirt on some mesh it's slightly seethrough. i'll wear it with a slip, but seriously for this price it should be lined",Positive
2961,"This is a great, versatile everyday tee. the fit is flattering, and the material is soft and lightweight. this, like many retailer tops, runs large under the arms. i first tried the medium, and although i liked the way the tee hung, it gapped in my underarms. there was no small in my store, so i tried on the xs. it still hung nicely, and no underarm gap. love the simple colors - denim blue and gray is a great combination. liked it enough to pay full price:)",Positive
2962,"Pictures don't do this dress justice, color in store is much more vibrant! embroidered flower is more orange/coral colored. also, at certain angles (depending on the lighting) this dress looks navy blue versus black, which i enjoyed. sizing - while i could have gotten away with my usual 8 the side view was too voluminous and somewhat unflattering so i ended up sizing down to a 6 for a more tailored look.",Positive
2967,"This is a soft, comfortable shirt. it fits like a t-shirt should. i usually buy m but based on other reviews i purchased s. the fit on me in size small is similar to the model in the photo.",Positive
2975,"I really wanted to love this dress, but it just didn't fit in anyway. i ordered an xs petite, and it was very large. the lacing in the back is completely useless, and that's what i liked about the dress. i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top (because of chest) and then lace more tightly near the waist. it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering. beautiful fabric, great color combo, bad fit.",Negative
2976,"I'm usually a 2-4 in retailer dresses and i was surprised how well the 2 fit. i like that the dress is navy instead of black, which makes it even prettier.the embroidery is very nice without being too much to wear for more casual activities. fabric is thick enough for wearing out in autumn with some tights and a sweater. prettier in person.",Positive
2984,I loved this shirt until the first time i washed it. it shrunk so much it became unwearable. when i returned it the salesperson said she had also bought this shirt and the same thing happened.,Negative
2986,The dress is too loose and runs too big,Negative
2988,"I was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store. but, i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric, which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash (even when following washing instructions). i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially! i'm so disappointed. how can you make a shirt that can't withstand washing?!",Negative
2990,Wish i would have read the reviews before i purchased and wore two of these. washed as directed and same outcome as everyone else. basically unwearable unless i maybe use it for a nightshirt. the shrinkage lengthwise was ridiculous. glad i didn't buy every color like i had planned to do!,Negative
2992,So disappointing! everything i've owned from bordeaux has washed well and stood the test of time. one wash and this was ruined! shrunk terrible even after washing in cold water on delicate and laying flat to dry. completely ruined. returned it.,Negative
2994,"Adorable, old school retailer; the only gripe i have is trying to get this on. the slip is similar to putting on a straight jacket. once you figure it out, then it's gorgeous. just be careful and lay it out carefully before you pull it over your head.",Positive
2997,This top is very cute but runs large. i am a 32b and i had to take the xsmall. the back of the bathing suit only has one slot for closing it up so you can't adjust it.,Positive
2999,It's a cute top but once i washed in cold water and laid flat to dry it shrunk and lost it's shape. very disappointed. i am going to return top.,Negative
3003,"As the previous reviewer stated, this skirt is a stunner, can be worn in all four season. it's long and runs on the larger side. so that you compare, i'm 5'9"" and it goes all the way to the side of my foot. i'm 146lbs, 28 waist, 38 hips and always a medium on maeve, this skirt on a medium was too big for me, at least a size larger. take that into account when ordering. other than that it's a great purchase. can't wait for my exchange to arrive.",Positive
3005,I thought this would be cute with leggings based upon the length on the model. i forget that the models are almost 6 feet tall. this has a polyester slip goes under it that snaps onto the shoulders. it came down to my knees and was completely like a sack no leggings and boots with this one. lovely material but not at all figure flattering.,Negative
3006,"I loved this shirt so much i bought it in 4 colors. however, two of them shrunk. i was very disappointed.",Negative
3010,"This dress is absolutely beautiful! and, had it been just a little longer or a little shorter i would have kept it. but, the hem hit me at just the wrong spot! alas, i had to send it back :(",Positive
3013,"This one didn't work for me. there is no zipper, you climb into it from the very large neck hole. it was very low cut and the shoulders kept sliding off but the bottom half fit snug. the tie and waist seam didn't hit at my waist but the largest part of my middle. i tried other belts and it wasn't much better. the fabric and print were great. i love jumpers but this one went back.",Negative
3017,"I loved this shirt when i got it. it fit perfectly, and was so soft. but when i washed it, following the instructions, it shrank up to well above my belly button. i'm talking 6 inches of shrinkage, at least.",Negative
3018,I saw this dress online and thought it might be an adorable eclectic piece to add to my closet. and was i right. the simple shape mixed with the bold pattern make this dress an awesome one to own. its easy and fun and funky. plus it has hidden pockets! beware though this dress seems to run a bit small. i would say if you switch in between sizes like me i can be a 6 or an 8 then possibly go with the larger size. i do have a large bust as well i wear a 34ddd so it shows some clevage but the girls,Positive
3025,Bought two of these because i loved the way they fit off of the rack. washed them according to directions and they were ruined. the material shrank up making the shirt short and boxy and the side panels ended up being rippled. definitely going to try to return these.,Negative
3030,I first saw this dress in one of the stores and the rich colors caught my eye. this dress is very comfortable to wear but is also unique. the fabric feels great on and gives the dress an overall stylish flair. the photo doesn't do it justice!,Positive
3035,"When the top arrived and i tried it on; it was great. the length was perfect even though i am curvy. after one wash (done according to the directions), the top shrank in length considerably. i do not mind paying a higher price for something unique and something of quality.....i do have a problem with something that does not hold up to basic use. i will be returning this item.",Negative
3038,"Wonderful fabric. surprisingly great fit. super flattering. i'm so glad i bought it, despite jumpsuits being a bit of a risk online.",Positive
3043,"I tried on and bought this shirt in my usual size and it fit long and loose but still had great shape. after hand washing in cold water and air drying, as per instructions on the tag, the shirt shrunk significantly. so much so that my stomach shows if i raise my arms at all. it also lost its shape, and now looks very boxy and is very unflattering. i won't be wearing it and am disappointed i didn't even get to wear it once!",Negative
3047,This product runs either really small or is super high waisted. either way not for me.,Negative
3053,These little shorts have become my favorite. they are so sweet and feminine and very comfortable. the fabric washes very well,Positive
3054,"I definitely agree with the other reviews, however i really like this skirt because it will go with a variety of tops to dress it up, or down, as well as color options. the tricky thing is that it runs super small. i'm usually between a 6, or 8 (28/29), and ended up getting a size 10. i don't like high waisted skirts or pants, so it sits just below my navel and is very comfortable. maybe best to try on in store, but worth it!",Positive
3056,"I wasn't sure about the color but ordered based on how much my stylist loved it. my usual xs petite fits perf daly, no chest problem (30dd) and the length is quite nice. romantic look, the drawstring in the back helps making sure the dress fits properly at the waist. it is a high low style with flowy skirt. overall great. i need to stop going to the store""",Positive
3057,"This sweater looked so promising with the tie waist and pretty lacy edging, but turned out to be a disappointment. it was much shorter than it looks in the photos and barely came to my hips. and the plum color was much darker than i expected, more of a dull brownish-burgundy.",Negative
3076,This is such a nice little sweater to add to a dress or tank. fits true to size and i love the tie and hook and eye closure. quality.,Positive
3078,"I saw this in the store, not on sale and loved it. was so happy when it went on sale! it is beautifully made and is soft and cozy.",Positive
3081,"I love these pjs! i thought $100 for the set was a little too pricey for me but as soon as they went on sale i knew i had to have them! they are so light and fresh, perfect for the texas heat! it helps that the print is absolutely precious as well!",Positive
3084,"I purchased both the floral sleep shorts and the top. the floral watercolor pattern is gorgeous and the fabric is very soft. like the other reviewers, i appreciate the feminine quality of this set while also being able to run around the house. i am 135 lbs and purchased a s.",Positive
3086,"What can i say? it's like wearing a hug. it's so wonderful i have a hard time taking it off at the end of the day! it's extraordinarily soft and thick, and stylish to boot! the one thing is that the thread holding the pockets together was already coming unraveled when i took it out of the package, and i had to sew them back on right away, as they were starting to come completely apart. a small price to pay for being a new owner of the best thing ever.",Positive
3089,I ordered the red/navy and i love that its a true red and navy. the subtle ribbing adds the right amount of texture. i normally order size small but i felt the top was a little big and has a very long hem line. i'm hoping it shrinks in the wash and i might alter the hem if its still too long after washing.,Positive
3092,"The colors are so pretty, a pinkish brown and a light brown trim. it is very soft and elegant looking. great with jeans or leggings. the tie is a little high in back but looks great. highly recommend!",Positive
3093,"This top is the bomb. the red is a perfect balance of washed out but still rich. the thin spaghetti straps and scooped back make it sexy, but it still looks effortless. perfect to pair with light weight, light wash jeans. it's also nice that it's not clingy at all, lends to the casual look. total keep for me.",Positive
3096,"I love this sweater! i ordered the dark gray and wasn't expecting fabulous but that's what i got. the skirt below the waist tie is actually pleated so that it falls perfectly. the seaming detail is beautiful. i am between a size large and extra large and the extra large fit perfectly. the sweater is short, half way down my hips but looks good over a long tank. this a medium weight knit and will be wearable all year with skirts, dresses and any kind of trousers. this is one of my favorite purchas",Positive
3102,"Did not work for me. material was a bit thin, poor quality, the tie doesn't quite work correctly. had a cheaper look to it. not the quality i'd normally expect. this is going back.",Negative
3105,The perfect cardigan for transitional seasons! i live in southern vermont and i can already tell this cardigan will be in heavy rotation during the summer to fall and spring to winter transition times. has such a cute back detailing that gives you a break from your common cardigans. great quality. i'm 126 lbs 5'4 and i got the small petite and is perfect if you want it to be slightly loose but not swimming in it!,Positive
3106,"Love this shirt, great fabric and fit. trying to wait for a sale to buy several others in additional colors.",Positive
3108,"It seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment. however, i found the band to be extremely small and tight. it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin.",Negative
3113,"This is a great sweater that i know i'll get a ton of use out of! i've already worn it three times, and i've had it a week. i typically wear small or medium in tops and sweaters, and ordered a medium in this one to ensure the arms were comfortable. the nude color is perfect.",Positive
3118,This has quickly become my go-to cardigan! it's light which will make it great for the spring and summer nights. i got it in the rose... and loved it so much i bought the olive too. bought a small- fits perfectly! arm length is great too.,Positive
3133,"Loved this top online but when i tried it on it was shorter than expected so only fitting for high waisted bottoms and much more boxy than it appeared online. i wish to high heaven that this top came in a more ""normal"" cut. hip length and slimming, the fabric and collar are beautiful!",Negative
3137,"I ordered the blue in size 16. it ran at least two, if not three, sizes too small compared to my other retailer 14 & 16 blouses. it was too small through the body, other than the peplum. the arms were tight too. the waistline and length matched the online photos. it's widening. the material they chose was also scratchy and rough, especially around the neckline. i returned mine after trying it on and seeing there was no way to make this work. the blue color was gorgeous though. the patterned lace w",Negative
3140,"Loved the look, fit and styling of this turtleneck. but dry clean only, you have to be kidding?",Negative
3141,"I love the coziness of this sweater. i do think it is designed for a looser fit, but i sized down for a closer fit. the sleeve design is unique and flattering i think, kind of of like a cap sleeve would be if you were wearing a long sleeve shirt under it. i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does shed some, but has so many other positive features that i am keeping it and plan to wear it with lighter colors so i don't need to worry about it.
just lovely really, love the blue color especially",Positive
3143,"This is the 2nd time i've purchased a dolan top and returned it b/c it was dry clean only. both tops were what i consider to be casual tops to be worn with a pair of jeans, running errands, etc. i do not dry clean this kind of casual shirt. it is made out of rayon, and that's the problem i think.

i purchased this in the wine color and it is a lovely color, hangs nicely, doesn't cling. the sleeves are a bit long but i could live with that -- i just pushed them up. as a turtleneck, it was a bit l",Negative

3168,"I wanted to love these jeans, but as a woman who is almost 45 there was way too much stretch in them. i am always a size 26 and i couldn't wear these, they were way too tight! they went back the next day. i will say, it could be my body type, i""m a runner so my legs are muscular. if you have very thin legs, these could be great and work for you. i loved the color, dark blue.",Negative
3169,Wow great soft feels great but not too clingy. only thing keeping from 5 start is that it will pill some. the sleeves are not fuzzy so they don't pill but body will/does.,Positive
3176,"I saw the cream top online and loved it, but it is even prettier in person. i typically purchase petite sizes online, but i tried on the 0 in the store and it fit nicely-- not super fitted throughout the waist as others have mentioned, but the length was just right and the arms/chest fit perfectly. for reference, i'm 5'2"", 100 lbs, 32b. this will look great with skinny pants or jeans.",Positive
3177,"Didn't like at all. itchy fabric, looked good on model but on on busty girl.",Negative

3196,"I bought the sweater in nude, and it fits perfectly. it is so much better than a standard cardigan- it has beautiful details. its drapes so well across your body, and it longer in the front than the back which makes it hang beautifully. i wear this to work, but would definitely wear this on the weekends for more casual outfits- its very versatile.",Positive

3218,"And not in a good way. everywhere i went, i left a little of this sweater behind. within hours of having it on, i was picking balls of fabric off the couch, bed, and the sweater itself looked like it was molting. great style, fabric and fit (although a little on the long side,) but there's no way i can keep it.",Negative
3229,"I bought these on sale and they quickly went back. i was very disappointed after reading the reviews. i thought for sure these would be a winner. however, i was sadly mistaken. i ordered another pair of jeans, the same, from a different brand. these were way too small while my others were too large. they didn't live up to my expectation and were still rather long. even though i bought these on sale, i was not happy with the quality.",Negative
3238,"The chevron pattern on the mint/seaside version needs to be centered in the front to look right. mine was totally off so i returned it and had them overnight me a new one to my vacation address. unfortunately, the 2nd suit i received was also ""off center"". that one is going back too. would have loved this otherwise! a quality check on this is definitely needed.... beware.",Negative
3242,"I love the fit of this sweater. i recently had a baby and am a little self-conscious of my stomach area. the sweater, in my usual size s, hides my problem area without being big and boxy. the weave seems like it will be prone to snags, so i'll have to be careful.",Positive
3246,This skirt is lovely and fits perfectly. the print on the front provides a great contrast to the back of the skirt and stands out. the material is thick enough to take you from fall to winter easily. and the fabric is structured enough to highlight all the right curves. a great purchase.,Positive

3260,Super cute dress but the waist band is very large and bulky.,Negative
3263,"I love the print and style of the skirt. it is very cute and feminine and can easily be worn into autumn. the downside is that the elastic waist is a little too loose and needs to be tighten. also, the is a lot of extra fabric in the skirt and makes it look so much larger than it is and it runs about 3 inches longer. for reference, i'm 5'5, 34 24 35 and the xs is loose in the waist. still, i really love the skirt and plan on keeping it and having it altered.",Positive
3264,"The skirt is lovely, has beautiful colors , and the touch of lace takes it to that ultra feminine level. it's a lot of skirt---yards of material and i like that it is fully lined, but this creates a problem, the source of the only negative thing i have to say about it. the only criticism i have is with the waistband---it's much too flimsy to stay up on the waist because of the weight of the skirt. i had my seamstress add a heavier weight elastic band inside the one it has or the skirt would star",Positive

3370,"I saw this dress and was immediately drawn to it. the pictures others posted of themselves wearing it just made me want it more. i knew the color said ivory when i ordered it, but i wasn't prepared for how yellow it was. there is a liner/slip and it was honestly a pale yellow. it made the whole thing look dingy. i was so disappointed. if this dress was white i would've kept it. sadly i had to return. i am 5'1, around 135 lbs and i ordered a petite 6. i probably could've gone a petite 4. very cut",Positive
3371,I bought this top after seeing it featured on a style blog. i was really excited to wear it until i realized how see thru it was. i had to put a cami underneath which detracted from the beauty of the top. even my flesh toned bra showed thru so i sadly had to return it.,Positive
3372,This shirt is so cute with the cutout stripes and it goes with everything. it's easy to wear and true to size. you can dress it up or dress it down. the fabric is soft but also light weight. i am so happy to own this classic piece.,Positive

the fabric is linen, very itch, so tank is probably needed underneath.
flattering fit for curvy figure.",Positive

3516,"This is by far one of my favorite dresses i have tried on in a long time. i am a 2-4, the small was tts and so flattering. i think this would be better for someone taller with a lean frame, though its not super tight and the material has a great weight to it, it isn't lined and could definitely show figure flaws. for me it skims my body elegantly and was very comfortable through the bust, waist and hip (34c/26/36). it fits me like the model in the image. the one down side is that it is pullover",Positive
3518,It's a beautiful top but not for bigger busts. ordered an xl and the top part would not button. i recommend for those with smaller busts.,Negative

3555,"I love this dress. i am wearing it for thanksgiving! i bought the black because the red was sold out, but would definitely buy more colors. true to size. i'm 5'6"" 135 and bought the 6. only issue is i have to wear a slip underneath because it's not lined and a tiny bit low cut for me.",Positive
3556,"Ordered online, and when it came i was very excited to open it - but the photo doesn't show how incredibly wide the cut is. it is also quite cropped and looked very awkward on me - 5'9, 130. the embroidery is lovely, but the style doesn't work. i had a small, but the area in the shoulders was cut very tight and it would not have worked well if i wanted to raise or lower my arms above shoulder height. might work better on someone with a more petite frame, but i do caution how ""voluminous"" the cut",Negative
3560,"I'm glad that i went with the other reviewers and sized down on this one. i bought this in a medium (usually wear a 10/12) and it fit perfectly. the colors and pattern are beautiful and will definitely look great with dark jeans/pants/shorts. the lace detail is just gorgeous! the bottom flows more loosely, but just enough to cover any midsection flaws and pairs nicely with dark skinny jeans.",Positive
3569,"I was so sad not to love this dress. it is beautiful, but is so unflattering on. there is a lot of material under the arms and it gathers up due to the smocking. so, it just made me look incredibly frumpy. i don't really think a petite would have helped - the gathers just bunch a bit and so rather than hang, the dress sort of clumps. i am lean but broad shouldered and maybe that is the problem, but i was super disappointed. narrow shouldered people with long torsos could pull this off. it is a t",Negative

3638,I'm not sure why this dress is getting great reviews. the plunging neckline is ridiculous and ran down to the underwire of my bra and the slit up the side came up to the upper part of my thigh. it was one of the worst fitting/cut dresses i've every tried on at retailer. i'm 5'4 125. maybe you have to be 6 feet tall and 90 pounds for this dress to not look like a bad renaissance faire costume.,Negative

4349,I loveeeeeeee this dress! i saw it online and immediately loved the blue/ orange large floral print but so did everyone else and it sold out quick. but i thought the shape could be flattering so i ordered in the black polka dot and loved the shape! so flattering. i ended up going in store and buying the other two colors. the patterns are vibrant and lovely shape. my only concern was seeing it in store i noticed it stretching while just hanging on the hanger. i wish the fabric was of better quali,Positive
4356,"If you want it, buy it now. this dress is everything and then some. love it. i bought two, the neutral (black) and the turquoise. the turquoise one is a very retro print, i am getting many compliments. they are so comfortable and flattering. i'm all about this price point retailer. more please!",Positive
4381,Lovely dress in bright teal color. the zipper was a bit sticky as the other reviewers had mentioned. unfortunately i sized up (6) based on past reviews and had to exchange for a smaller size(4). the fabric does have a bit of stretch so i'm really not sure why so many people had sizing issues. this is really a great buy with the current sale. tempted to pick up the red version too.,Positive

4389,"I wanted to like this dress, but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose, does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy, so if you are well-endowed, your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result, the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model), and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves, this would likely be very flattering, but",Negative
4396,I have several maeve dresses that fit really well. this was not the case with this dress. fabric and color are great! fit was off especially in top. worst part was zipper that wouldn't move smoothly. took me a good 15 minutes to get it unzipped. such a bummer!,Negative
4399,"I watched this dress for quite awhile and when it went on sale ordered it. i'm very happy with the purchase. it's swingy and fun, looks great with tall boots too. i said it runs true to size but i bet the size smaller would have been great too just because it is a bit of a looser fit.",Positive

4518,"I bought this top in the store, which was good because i ended up wearing a size smaller than i usually do. i loved the flowy fit of it. the washing instructions say machine wash cold, tumble dry low. i washed it on cold and hung it to dry. it shrank to the point of being unwearable (the dreaded button gap!) and lost its softness. i hope the store lets me return it.",Negative
4527,"I am normally a 4, but they only had the white in size 2, so i tried it. i was pleased to see that it worked out just fine because it is meant to flow, therefore has plenty of fabric. it is very graceful and very pleasant to wear. i don't know how to explain it, but i had to take a second look when i saw it on the photograph because i was not sure it was the same blouse. much better in reality than on the picture.",Positive
4530,"I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined, i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn't show.  even though the shorts are lined, you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and, comfortable waistline.  i'm returning the shorts as well.",Negative
4537,I tried this in store and fell in love. i'm usually between a 0 and a 2 in tops and took this in a 0 because of how flow and lose this is. the fabric is light and not bulky so it can also be tucked in.,Positive

4546,I loved the star pattern of this top but the cut was odd. it is very big in the chest and full at the bottom. for anyone who is petite on top it tends to look sloppy.,Negative

4799,"I seldom buy prints and almost never buy a traditional button front blouse but this shirt is my favorite purchase of the season. i chose the skier print as it was whimsical and subtle. rather than wear it buttoned and tucked i use it as a jacket over solid tees. i bought it a size larger for this reason. i like the layered look and the fabric is flowy and drapes nicely. i have been so pleased with every piece of ""maeve"" clothing i have purchased. once again thinking slightly outside my comfort-z",Positive
4800,"This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well, but one was cut much smaller than the other. i've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i don't understand why in size 14 & 16, this keeps happening. that's why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other doesn't. this time, unfortunately, neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders",Negative

4843,"This top is too short, so much so that tucking it in would be difficult. the designs are lovely, but the short length is putting this top back on the rack.",Negative
4844,Wanted to love this colorful romper. the fabric was suuuuper thin and very cheap feeling and looking. no way would i wear this.,Negative
4855,"The skiers, cats, and puffin patterns are adorable and i was very tempted to keep the shirts just for the patterns. unfortunately, the fit was awful. i am short and need to highlight my waist and this shirt did the opposite. the skier fabric is also see-through. the tenting issue could be fixed if you belt the shirt or tuck it in, but it is not very long. 100% rayon fabric is a bummer too. the shirt was snug at the bicep, but not as bad as i expected from the reviews. i sized up from an 8 to 10.",Negative
4861,I was very excited about this product. when i saw it the pattern was beautiful in the romantic floral and the bottom band looked like the bathing suit was a little longer so i felt it would be good for a large chest. when i received the package i knew instantly it ran small. i tried it on and it barely covered half of my chest. also the band at the bottom is actually very small and not what i expected. the print is just as lovely in person as it is online. i don't even know if sizing up will mak,Negative
4871,The dress runs big you should size down. i find the weight to be great for mild winter weather. the length was longer than i expected based on previous reviews.,Positive

4880,I love these pants and wear them all the time. i wish they hadn't been discontinued,Positive

4910,"First of all, i am only 5'1"", so this adorable tunic does fit me like a dress. i am also pear shaped, and this dress is flattering to my shape. but my biggest issue, it that the dress came in very wrinkled, especially the ruffles.
i took the dress to my retailer store, and they were able to steam some of the wrinkles out, but not all of them. it seems that the fabric used for the ruffles is suppose to be a little crinkly. but it will most likely look worse after you sit. therefore, i am uncertain",Positive
4924,"I love(d) this top. it was my go to top even in the heat, the fabric is light and breathes. however, pulled it out of the washing mashing to find that the sleeve has shredded away from the body. it could not be repaired. i am so disappointed as i really loved everything about it.",Negative
4936,"I love finding unique retailer pieces that don't require dry cleaning. i was excited to find this shirt, but it's not flattering. the bottom hem is a little tight, which makes the rest of the shirt look bulky. perhaps it would work better on people who have narrow hips. i also didn't like the pink tones when i saw the colors in person. i'll be returning this item.",Negative
4953,"This skirt is absolutely beautiful. the design and organza are so feminine, and i love the length. it flows beautifully and it isn't stiff or anything, but it does hold its shape well. i ordered it through the store, and the wrinkles came out easily after it hung for several days. i think it would be easy to snag the material, so i will be really careful when i'm wearing it. the zipper is a little hard to pull all the way to the top of the skirt, and i worry a little about the hook and eye closu",Positive

4957,"I drooled over this dress online, so couldn't pass up trying it on at my local retailer store. while i loved the unique color in person, & the drape of the skirt (good quality, fully lines), i was so disappointed with the top of this dress! it's very tight, ill-fitting, & just plain...weird. i can't imagine the fit of the top being flattering on anyone, regardless of chest size. it's a shame, because otherwise, the dress is adorable!",Negative

4960,"This dress is cuter is person than online, but it has one huge issue - there is a teeny tiny button at the neck that is held on by a thread and requires fingers the size of a two year old to get open. it fell off the minute i tried to undo it. i can't believe these other reviewers didn't have the same problem. or, maybe they put a snap there instead. too bad.",Negative

4969,"I love the color of this dress. it is not flattering, even though it should be. the weird panels of different materials makes it hang super funky. the lace is heavy but the silky panels aren't. so not flattering, it's just odd. and the fit is super huge, you are swimming in it in addition to a poor body drape. it could have been so cute, but was executed so poorly.",Negative
4992,"I don't understand the negative review
on this sweater. it is nothing short of stunning. the quality and design are absolutely beautiful! and i love the lined pockets! i can honestly say i don't think i'll ever part with it - this is a sweater you hang onto forever. i will say it runs a bit large. i ordered the xs/sm and if i didn't know better i would think its m/l. either way if you can you get your hands on one in store or a return online, do it! it is worth every penny, especially for the s",Positive
5005,"What a let down. the sweater i received in no way resembles the product pictured. based on the original price point, i envisioned a beautiful hand-knitted sweater made of high grade yarn/ wool that i could use for travel. instead, i received something that is grossly oversized for xs/s, made out of weird crafting yarn and looks like an ugly holiday sweater. my kids could make something better than this on their toy loom. not the quality i expected from retailer. back it goes.",Negative
5006,"This is a simplistic beauty. the colors are lovely and as pictured. i believe it is tts but if your small busted you could probably go down a size. i personally stayed with my small and i lke the flow of it. the flannel has a nice weight to it so you can wear this fall, winter and early spring if you live in a cooler climate.",Positive
5014,"I thought this would be a cute business attire skirt. i hate to say it, but i felt like it flared out as if i were amelia bedelia or some whacky children's book character and not retailer. the fabric made it look bulky. i sadly had to return it.",Negative

5019,"I have wanted this dress since i first tried it on in april. finally got it as a birthday gift and after looking at it closely there was makeup on the collar. i checked the instructions and it says ""cold water wash"". so i washed only the collar part by hand and every part that got water on it bled!!! looks like the popsicles are melting! i'm so sad because this dress is adorable! i'm buying another in hopes retailer will make this right by taking back the first one. should be dry clean only!",Negative
5023,"Such a beautiful and unique design - i only wish it fit! it is so, so boxy - i'm thin, but would have needed almost a foot of fabric removed in order to make it look right (and i don't mean making it super tight). the seaming and button details on the back are such that it would be tough to have a tailor refit it appropriately. so, i had to return this, despite really wanting to find a way to make it work.",Negative
5027,"This dress is very cute and well made. unfortunately it was too short waisted for me and runs small in the bust. the arm holes were too big yet the bust small, very weird fit on me. i am six feet tall with 38c bust, maybe if you are shorter with smaller chest this dress will work for you. it has a thin lining and is not see through even though it is white fabric. i love the dress it just wasn't made for my tall figure.",Negative
5030,"I was so excited to get this classic-looking retailer dress- i love the ladylike shape and whimsical print. the popsicle print on this dress is really, truly adorable. unfortunately, the dress is cut really weird and it made me feel like screaming: i bought a size two and it was snug and gaping at the chest (and i'm only a 32b, ladies, so be warned!) at the same time, the arm holes were huge, i mean massively big. i think if you have a swimmer's body this might work. otherwise, you'll for sure nee",Negative
5040,"I love the look of this dress on model but sadly, fit didn't work out. very short waisted and tight across chest with very ample arm holes. i'm 5'8"", 155, 34c, reliably a size 10. this dress seemed at least 2 sizes off for me. my daughter, usually a size 2, could wear it except for the arm hole size (and the fact that it's 158 dollars and she's 13....going back.) btw, ""novelty print"" means ""ice cream novelty"", little popsicles with bites taken out - cute but more juvenile than i expected.",Negative
5043,"I was struggling with the options above-- does it fit true to size or is it too small or too large? it is both too small and too large, which is really strange. the model makes this shirt look stunning, but the product is actually very boxy. i am 5' 3"", weigh 112 lbs and i typically order anywhere from a 00p-0r/xxs-xs. i ordered this shirt in an xsp and the shirt sleeves were short and the middle was boxy. quite frankly, it looked like a maternity shirt and the structure was not worth the money",Negative
5067,"As another reviewer pointed out, although the tag inside the dress says that you can machine wash in cold water, the color around the popsicles will bleed! this is extremely disappointing. i'm hoping it can either be fixed with dye remover, or that retailer will take this item back. would only dry clean this item.",Negative

5109,The print and front ruffle are beautiful. the sleeves are awful and poorly represented in the picture of the model. it's almost like the sleeves have a life of their own - so mismatched with this style of blouse. such a beautiful print but so disappointing in shape.,Negative
5114,"What a disappointment and for the price, it's outrageous!",Negative
5121,There's a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views. it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse. the print is lovely but the fit is very odd. it's pulls at and is very tight through the bust too. i wear medium or large and ordered size large. if you're less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you. but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide. returned.,Negative
5122,"I love this designer and decided to give this one a try. i ordered size large in black. it's a nice weight knit but not too heavy. good for fall and winter. the color is an intense,  saturated black that's really sharp looking. i thought it split up both sides, however, it's only split on one side and then angles across the back to the other side, which isn't split and is shorter.  i carry weight in my midsection, and this flows a bit away from the body but not in a giant oversized way. i like t",Positive

don't buy these -- you will be very disappointed.",Negative

5186,This shirt has absolutely no shape. look carefully at the model and you we discover she is cleverly positioned to hide the sheer boxy-ness of this shirt. the print is beautiful but it looks like a maternity shirt. i even ordered the xs at 5'7 and 130 lbs but found it too baggy. returned.,Negative

5228,This dress is a zillion times cuter in real life. it's very retro-swingy and girlish- it reminds me of something mia farrow would've worn in her rosemary's baby era. i have the black version and i've paired mine with tall black gladiator sandals for a more sultry nighttime look and also flip flops for beachy summer days. i think it's a total steal at the sale price.,Positive
5234,Great fabric and color but fits like a potato sack -- so sad bc i would have loved it,Negative
5239,The dress is extremely high quality! i purchased the dress in black. the white collared shirt that the model is wearing under the dress is not part of the dress. the dress overall is like a balloon. unless you're extremely tall and skinny this dress makes you look bigger! i ordered the small petite and am 125 lbs and 5'4. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it's going back:( the petite hits 3 inches above the knee for reference.,Negative
5241,"This top has a nice design. i love the lace up back which makes it much more adjustable in shape. if you lace it lower it is more flattering to your waist. however the fabric quality is very poor on the white tank. it arrived with a small tear in the front hem area, which i could have easily fixed. it is very sheer; even with a nude bra, my bra was too visible for my comfort. plan on wearing a full camisole underneath, tank, or bralette you are fine with being on display.",Negative

5306,"I've never spent this much money on a sweater but took the plunge using the retailer day discount. still painful but hopeful it would be worth it. i ordered the xl hoping to compensate for the shorter length. and it fell just below my hip bones so that part was okay. while this looks like the cashmere is on the thinner side, so the garment flows nicely, it's not. the weight of the sweater is substantial, heavier and much thicker than it looks. the color is different too. it's tan and grey, not whi",Negative
5312,"I agree with the other reviewer. the colors were fabulous, but it was boxy and fit me like a sack. the slits on the side really detracted from the cute fabric and the hood drooped way in the back due to being able to pull away from the slits. it was really a cute idea and i'm sad it didn't work. i started not to order it based on the first review but i wanted to give it a chance,--i should have listened !",Negative
5313,"Wasn't expecting this to look good on when i grabbed it off the sale rack. to my surprise it's very cute. the very high up slits for the 2 front panels and the lightweight knit break up the heavy appearance of this poncho when it's on. you can slip your arms out of the sleeves to keep warm when the evening gets cooler. i love it. got the gray and black stripes on off white background. will try belting the two front panels, as another reviewer suggested. i'm 5'3"" petite. so, it doesn't swallow me",Positive

i highly recommend this timeless piece.",Positive

5806,"I'm 5'5"" and 140 lbs - hardly super-tiny and the xs was swimming on me. the shoulders are oddly large and this beautiful sweater/jacket just hangs off the body. believe it when they say ""oversized styling"" - unfortunately will have to return.",Negative

5822,These pants are really cute and comfortable. the fit is very nice.,Positive
5830,"I bought these to wear to a christmas party with a lacy blouse, but found they were what's been missing in my life. after wearing them nearly every other day, i decided i needed another pair.

feel like yoga pants but look polished. make your butt look perky and your legs slim. .... maybe i need another pair!",Positive
5835,I did not try this on alone but rather with a long sleeve white tee and white button down shirt. i really liked both looks. if i find it to be itchy like the other review i will have to return. this is an effortless fashion statement yet it could easily be a weekender cozy staple. my only complaint is why two neutral colors? this would have been great if offered in a richer darker yarn. the two offered colors are so similar and both looked drab against my skin tone.,Positive
5837,"Me: 5'6"", 130, waist 28/39, hips 36/37. tried the size 27, the usual for me in pilcro. they fit like a glove and i loved them. i clearly needed a 2-3"" heel to do them justice and now i see the photos of my rear i'm a bit doubtful but pilcros always stretch a little and these are super soft and funky.
a win!",Positive
5841,"I found this dress to be very short waisted, much closer to an empire waist than shown in the picture. it was also an inch or two longer in the skirt than other maxi dresses i've gotten from retailer. it really could have used those inches above the waist. just a strange fit overall.",Negative
5856,"I have never been able to find a maxi dress that just fits me. i'm pretty short (5'2"") and the xs petite comes exactly to my ankles. no hemming necessary! the neckline is very flattering and the waist is a semi-empire elastic waistline that makes this dress both elegant and comfortable. the dress is very stretchy but doesn't look like it. it is absolutely one of my ""summer staples"" now - especially for traveling. if i could have this dress in fifty different patterns i would.",Positive
5861,"This is like wearing an afghan, but i get cold really easy so for me that's a good thing. and it's super soft and not itchy. i could easily never take this off. runs a little large, but that should be fine when it gets layered. ...only thing i didn't like was the one long stitch that holds the wrap in place. i worry it will snap and the whole thing will unravel.",Positive

5867,"I love this dress as far as the fit goes. it makes my curvy figure loook even better with how it's cut. that being said the different patterns over each boob made the dress look crazy. it makes you look quite lopsided in the chest. wasn't just me, but my store people also agreed. had the pattern on the chest been the same it would be great, but even though my boobs are of ""mostly"" equal size, they looked too crazy. it's quite noticeable on. so sad:(",Negative
5872,"This top was different than what i normally wear but based on good reviews i purchased. i really love it. it is different than i thought it would be. i thought it was longer sleeves but it is just above the elbow. definitely need a tank or something underneath as it is see through and the sleeve holes are quite large. 
definitely recommend.",Positive

5895,"I purchased in the raspberry, love this color and the asymmetrical design is super cool, and the color is unique - however i am on the fence. this knit top is very thin and for the price and to wear in the cold fall and going into winter i think i need it to be more of a light sweater or at least a thicker fabric. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs. and the small fits perfect. the sleeves are long which you tall gals will love.",Positive
5900,"I wanted to love this, but instead of being a flowy kimono top as pictured- it was a thick blazer type garment. not at all what is pictured here unfortunately. also it was much shorter than pictured and i am only 5'4''.

would not recommend",Negative
5916,I love floreat and was excited to find this top on sale. i received multiple compliments the first day i wore it. it is true that it might be better with a bit less fabric but it wasn't a deal breaker for me. the flowy shape it ideal for summer.,Positive
5918,I love this tank to wear alone because it is soft and more lovely than a basic plain tank. it is especially great to layer with a sweater/ cardigan. the colors are always fabulous and the design is wonderfully feminine. i own several and love them all. it's a great value especially on sale. i normally wear a size 6 and the small fits perfectly.,Positive
5928,"The top is gorge, it may look somewhat slouchy but it falls perfect and looks great, especially the navy color with white jeans. i liked it so much i ordered the ivory color too. beware the quality of this top is extremely delicate and if you don't want it to snag, do not wear a bracelet that can snag it.",Positive
5931,Love this dress! accents your curves and slims you waist!,Positive

would highly recommend!",Positive
5943,I bought this top in pink today and it is a beautiful bright pink spring color. i did have to size down from my normal size six all the way down to a 2 due to armholes being being too big. i tend to have a chronic problems with armholes being big so not sure others may find the same problem however i typically size down to a 4 when armholes too big. plenty of room in body still but i lost some length. i do have a short torso so can get a way with this. aside from my armhole problem it is a gorge,Positive

5962,"I ordered the coral/peach version in size 16. it ran small, especially compared to other size 14 or 16 maeve blouses i've purchased. very tight throughout the blouse. the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived. the material was extremely cheap in quality. it wrinkled terribly. the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet. the idea of this was perfect for my style. unfortunately, the poor choice in material & poor fit made this a return for me.",Negative

6000,I bought this in blue and love it. i usually wear an xs to small in retailer shirts and a small to medium in dresses. i ended up with an extra small petite in this. it is really flattering and hides the stomach enough. i highly recommend the dress if you size way down.,Positive
6003,This is my favorite kind of neckline. it is very flattering & cool for summer. my only complaint is the armpit scoops down a little too low. but i will just wear a bandeau underneath it. its super cute. will be great for vacationing & next summer.,Positive
6004,"Per the other reviews i sized up and got the medium. it was still tight around the girls (and i'm not that well endowed), but too big in the armholes. the fabric is a kind of thin tee shirt material. i kept it (because i'm lazy) but not sure how much i'll wear it given the strange fit.",Negative
6016,"I am really happy with these jeans. fun fit, high waisted, great detail, and have just the right amount of stretch. i have worn them 4 times and haven't washed them yet (i find this helps shape my new jeans) and they still fit like a comfortable glove. a different twist on the ripped up jeans because of the color! love them! i normally fit a 29, ordered 28 in these and they are perfect!",Positive
6017,"When you look at the online pictures of the navy colored dress, the stripes are diagonal. however, that is not the case with the dress in person. the stripes are all horizontal and not that flattering. such a bummer because i love maeve dresses and thought this would be a great addition to my summer dress rotation. alas, not very flattering, so back it goes.",Negative

6036,"I love this top! i ordered the print, and it will go perfectly with blue or white jeans, and even coral shorts. very flattering. i did go up a size (from xs to s) based on other reviews, and i'm glad i did. the larger size fits perfectly at the bust and falls just below the hip.",Positive
6041,"I was so excited to get this top in the mail. i loved the colors, print, cut, everything. i put it on and was so disappointed, the top looks so much better on the model. i don't know if i should have gone down a size (i go between an xs and s), but it looked terrible on me! my husband took one look at me in it and said that's being returned. still disappointed",Negative
6047,I love the teal/aqua version. the colors are very pretty and look great with jeans. i got a medium. it runs a tiny bit small but a lot of fitted tops at retailer run smaller on me. i like the style a lot and the peplum is great.,Positive

6070,"This shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it. i am fairly small- usually a 4 or 6 in tops, and smaller on top- barely 34b. this top was incredibly unflattering, falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy-- like a pillowcase/sacklike fit. there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me. it's unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders- a nice transition to fall. unfortunately",Negative

6084,"I do not have a waist that goes ""in"". i either have to wear shift dresses that are cut slim, or find ""fit and flare"" pieces that create a waist for me. this is the latter. it's really cute, different and flattering. it has a nice mix of graphic sophistication with a somewhat romantic silhouette. it is gauzy with ruffles and tiers. the off-white slip underneath is great for a couple reasons: it provides a nice underlayer that is just visible underneath the ""turtleneck"" top, cutting the school-mar",Positive

the top runs a bit on the full side, so if you are in between sizes, i would go down one. this top is great to wear under any open sweater for the entire fall season. the green color is a jewel green so the top does not look summary at all.

6160,"A great sweater to throw over just about anything. i love it, but the only reason i couldn't give it 5 stars is because you must be very carful with it, as it can snag on anything. the fabric is similar to intertwined ribbons. the first time i put it on i got a snag right away, but it was easily pulled trough to the inside. now i am just super cautious. i do love it though. very comfortable and super casual. not heavy at all, but just enough to be happy to have to throw on when the cool spring/s",Positive

sadly, i had to return both. perhaps this would look better on someone with a much taller frame.",Negative
6516,This was so boxy and unflattering. i loved the lining and the fabric was very soft but it looked like i was wearing a bag. was hoping to use this as a cute top layer for dresses but it was a terrible fit. sizing down would not help this one. went back!,Negative

6938,I was so excited to get this dress since it look so pretty on line but unfortunately the it was horrendous on. the model must have the dress tailored because it looks like a huge tent on me. it was very wide bust down and made me look 30 lbs heavier. i'm 5'4 and 125 lbs- ordered extra small and it fits bust up and arms so i say it's tts up top.,Negative

navy is one of my most flattering colors, but the navy in the dress did not make up for the yucky second color that was so blah it just reminded me of dirt. that second color made me look drab.

6990,"I love the color, the fabric and the style (especially in the model shots) but in reality, the cut is disproportionate. the hips and hip pockets flare out creating a saddlebag look. it is not smooth and fitted as shown on the model. overall you need to size down since i could pullover the dress without unzipping. i think the felted boiled wool is great quality but a tiny bit itchy. i still recommend the dress because i will be wearing it with a long sweater coat which will hide the weird hip act",Positive
6991,"When i saw this tunic dress, i knew immediately that i would wear it and it would become a favorite of mine. the cut is unique and it is versatile enough to mix and match with many different things. it is also very comfortable, true to size and very good quality material. i highly recommend.",Positive

7136,"This blazer is really well made, it has a nice weight and stretch to it. i think it might run a bit on the large size, i am sometimes a small and sometimes an xs and the xs is perfect. it's a great blazer to throw on to cinch together a casual yet put together look. i don't think the picture here does it justice. it will be getting a ton of wear in my work wardrobe. i love it!",Positive
7140,"After reading previous reviews i definitely had to give this a try since i have broader shoulders than the average woman. my regular size (small) was not available anymore so i went with medium and i have to say it worked out well. the small would have not given me the slouchy factor that the medium gives me. this top definitely has no problem staying ""off the shoulder"" since i have broad shoulders it doesn't completely come off me. loving the boho-chic vibe of this!",Positive
7146,"Like most people here, i wanted this beautiful dress to fit. so, i decided to see for myself if maybe, just maybe the negative reviews were wrong. they weren't. if you have any sort of breasts at all, the top probably won't fit properly. i imagine a narrow upper torso, like a 32 or 33, possibly a 34 might find the top part of the dress closes properly, but with a 36 c, i could not get a size 12 to button up. the waist hit at a strange spot, and despite the picture showing a narrow waist and grad",Negative

7174,"This dress fit so oddly. i tried on two different sizes and both did this super unflattering poochy thing at the belly. the dress wasn't tight at my hips in either size, it was just that there was weird extra fabri right around the midsection that stuck out. maybe i was too short? couldn't figure it out. 

the color and detailing are beautiful though! a little tight in the bust.",Negative

7389,Hello i could not see how this dress could get anything but a 5 star review . the only thing that i thought would be a negative is that it may stag easily. other than that this dress is stunning on and i feel it runs large . i wear a sz 4 and the xs fit just right i'm 5ft 6in tall looks great with a high heel since its really long to the floor which i like as far as the shine on this dress. i love it it makes it worth the price and dresses up a casual dress . and its very comfortable .,Positive
7392,"Stunning on, but mine was missing a button when i received it. i found a similar button and replaced it. still worth it, even though it arrived ""damaged""",Positive
7393,"I broke my rule of not buying polyester for this dress, twice (helped by sale price with additional percent off promo). it's mainly the irresistible print, i bought it in both the lovely blue-pink floral and the patterned red. love it. works best when the weather is in upper 60s, with tights and boots, but i think it will also work with bare legs and clunky sandals when the weather is warmer. the fit is loose except for in the chest and shoulders, so don't size down. i do wish the fabric was not",Positive
7394,"I debated getting this dress for over a month and finally purchased it on retailer member day for 20%off. i wore it on a chiller night with a denim jacket and booties for a more casual feel. constant compliments from friends and strangers. 

only complaint about the dress is the slit. it does not go as high like on the model, stops right at the knee.the cross over is not too revealing (which is nice). overall the fit is great! im 5&#39;6 and usually size 12 and 36dd, the large was perfect!",Positive
7397,"This is a great casual top for spring! i loved the covered buttons in the back, and the longer back peplum too. the peplum in the front covers the top of pants. i am 5'9"" tall and often times have difficulty finding sleeves that are long enough, so the 3/4 length sleeves are perfect. the fabric is light weight but not sheer, and the embroidered dots are well done.",Positive

7409,"I am in love with this dress. not too dressy, not too casual and hugs the body in all the right spots. i am 5'7 with curves and this flatters well. i also bought (and adore) the velvet taupe ankle strap shoes they show with them, super in-love with the whole look. dress will look great with booties too. just hope i don't snag the sweater dress, which looks easy to do, because i want to wear this all fall and winter long.",Positive
7411,"This is a beautiful shirt. the back is a few inches longer than the front which makes for a cool effect.
the only thing that i didn't like about this shirt was how fragile the buttons on the back are. i was taking this shirt off and one popped off. when i went to hang it, another one popped off! so i had to return it. such a shame.",Negative

7420,This dress will be perfect for the mid-september wedding i'm attending. september is a transitional month fashion-wise and this knit dress will be perfect. the shimmer (which isn't apparent from the website) makes it festive enough for a wedding.,Positive
7425,"This is the most unflattering peplum top i have ever tried on. fit perfectly as a size 6 should in the arms, shoulder, chest... then the waist was huge! just hung off of me like a flour sack. it was wider than the chest measurements, which made me appear frumpy instead of tailored and classic. combine that with the high-low hemline and it looked like a project runway reject. sent back immediately, do not buy this if you have (or want to appear to have) an hourglass figure, it will do nothing for",Negative

7429,I feel like i'm cheating when i put this on it's so comfy almost like wearing cozy pj's but with my black belt and boots and a cute scarf i can easily wine and dine looking like a million bucks and feeling like i'm lounging at the same time. i wish this came in more colors!!,Positive

loved the idea of this sweater, but this was not what i was hoping for",Negative
7435,"I love everything about this except the length. i am short and usually order a petite and even this is really cropped on me. the quality is good, thick and substantial, color is great but very cropped and sleeves are long on me as well. just weird proportions so sadly, going back.",Negative
7437,"I was pleasantly surprised by how well this dress skims over the body. definitely needs the belt that comes with the dress to add some shape. the color is gorgeous, great print and very light fabric - perfect for summer.",Positive
7438,"The minute i put this sweater on, i couldn't wait to take it off. it was way too scratchy for me. so, for those with any type of sensitivity to wool, this is not the sweater for you. otherwise, i thought the design was quite cute.",Negative
7446,"Note the sleeves on the model. that is how your regular size will fit your arms. however, even if you have skinny arms like i do, the sleeves will be tight. i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only 5 ft 2 in.
i advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested. the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon.",Negative
7449,"Nice lines and texture but fit is very tight and i experienced the sizing to run small. i am 5'6"" and 115# with small frame. i usually wear xs or s from retailer, so ordered the turtleneck in small. the size small was super tight. i love the design so exchanging my order for a medium.",Positive
7461,Chic and comfortable and looks great with skinny jeans or leggings. i'm usually a small/medium and thought the medium had a better overall look - sleeves were just a little long. the detail on the sleeves is kind of like the inside of a sweatshirt and makes it look a little more polished than the average athleisure top.,Positive
7463,"This is a very nice turtleneck. the variations in the ribbing are a modern (and flattering) touch. in some of the photos online it almost looked to me like there are color variations - fyi there are not. all the ribbing areas are the same shade of black.

7472,"I feel that for this price, i should love this top (and i wanted to). however, the price is on the high side for a relatively basic top, and there were a few things about it that could be improved.
pros: i ordered a medium and feel that it's pretty true to size. additionally, the fabric is nice and light (but also *sheer*) and, generally speaking, has a nice pattern. overall, it's a very pretty top.
cons: there's a cute criss-cross ruffle thing happening in the back but the model has cleverly",Negative

7482,"I took advantage of the sale this weekend & purchased this super cute vest yesterday which made it a more justifiable purchase. it's so soft, fits tts & i just can't wait for cooler weather so i can start wearing it!",Positive
7485,"Loved these culottes! flattering fit and nice drape. the fabric, though poly, is of a nice weight and swishes nicely as you walk. the length (just below knee length) works for me too. the color is lovely for the fall - rich copper and easy to pair . i'd say these are tts but if in doubt, size down. i""m between a size 8-10 and the 8 works best for me.",Positive
7487,This robe is incredibly soft! it is wonderful to put on right after a shower and it is very warm! the sleeves are lined with a jersey like material and they are so easy to get on and off. it fits true to size. i am so excited to have this robe!!!,Positive
7489,"So bummed. i was really hoping this top would work for me. i got the black in regular size 4 and the pink in petite size 4. both hit my breast too high and were too bulky in the mid section. i have a sort of short torso, wear a small 34c, and am have a defined waist. when tops are bulky, it gives me no shape and just looks terrible. i am having the hardest time finding pretty tops that suit my figure. they did not lie flat like on the model but had so much extra fabric they stuck out.

7493,"Cute and comfy. if you don't throw a leg out like the model above, it mostly reads as a skirt because the legs are so full. but it's really comfortable, and pairs well with a surprising number of tops",Positive

7512,"I have a few evening functions this month and the next few months and i thought this dress would be different and fun. i really wanted to like it, but i could not. there were spots missing sequence, some fell off as i tried the dress on, and i did try it on twice. each time there were some on the floor. they are sewed on so poorly, for the price of this dress. i fear it would be a dress for one season and i'd have to throw it out. not for that price. so back it goes.",Negative

7524,"I really liked the look of the orange so ordered an xs. i prefer a s petite but it is sold out. the xs arrives and while i still like the color, the fit is really weird. the cowl is very high up but the sleeves are still long. it looks nothing like the photo. i cannot see how the cowl sits on the model's collar bone. despite eliding the color, the design is off so have to return.",Negative
7527,This sweater was so itchy i immediately was turned off. it looks cute in pictures but another problem was that the knitting in the shoulders looks like a kid made it. it was uneven and stretched out. it looked like it was not well made to me. it also shed so much that just from me trying it on my pants were covered in orange fuzz. i returned this one.,Negative
7529,"This sweater was just okay. i am happy to pay $100 or more for a sweater but this one was somewhat itchy, and not the quality i expected for that price. i may have kept it if it were at about half the price, but it just was not worth it. retailer prices seem to be going up and up and the quality less and less. i had similar experiences with a couple of shirts that i ordered over the summer. looked great in the photos, but unfortunately in person were not quality garments.",Negative
7538,"Absolutely love this top! yes it runs big and is flowy but i think it is very flattering, especially with skinny jeans. loved it so much i bought the navy and wine colors for myself and the green for my mom. for reference i'm 5'7"" 115 lbs (33-25-33) and the xs fit well (falls just above my mid thigh).",Positive
7540,The front of this top is pretty thin and you can see through it,Positive

7563,The material is very nice. not flimsy at all which is nice. the problem was the fit around the arms. i am a petite person with a small chest but it still didn't cover me bra. i'll be returning it.,Negative
7566,"I really like both colors in this top. i love the way it lays, the length, the material, etc. what i don't like is that the arm holes are very large and shows the entire side of your bra. this is definitely a summer top so why would someone want to have to wear a cami when it's warm enough to go sleeveless? too bad, i would have bought it for sure.",Negative

7586,"So simple to throw on with jeans, or you could dress it up. the ruffles give it a little extra flair. nice and soft, really comfy. i haven't decided which size i am going to hold onto. i ordered in a small and a medium. small fits me great, and i am usually a pretty standard medium. i think it just depends on what look you are going for.  wish they had it in a lighter color, like an ivory or pink.  i think the ruffle detail would look nice with a lighter shade.",Positive
7588,"Love this top! i tried it on in the store and instantly loved. i wore it and ordered it in another color. i bought my usual size but decided i'd like to have it slightly smaller for the next one, so i ordered down. it can go either way, it's quite flawy and roomy. cool for summer and supper flattering.",Positive
7589,"This is my new favorite white top in my closet - the loose fit, flowy quality fabric, and effortless versatility are spot on for anyone's wardrobe. i took my usual size s - i wouldn't size down in this because although it's roomy in the torso, the sleeves and shoulders fit perfectly on my thin arms. everyone should have this beauty!",Positive
7592,"I think this dress is my favorite purchase this whole year! it fits like a dream! i saw it in the store while it was full price and tried on an 8 (the only size they had left!). i typically wear a 6 or 8 in dresses, but the 8 was quite large, so i passed. after it went on sale, i ordered a 6 with my fingers crossed! glad i ordered when i did, as they sold out fast! fabric is a nice substantial weight, great for fall! the fit is great, not tight at all and more of an a-line on me, which is weird",Positive
7598,Much softer fabric than i expected. wrinkles easily.,Positive
7600,I am so glad i purchased this top and read the reviews thoroughly. i am usually a 10 or medium in tops because of my broad shoulders (for reference 5'9 145 lbs and athletic build). i decided to size down to an 8. the top fits perfect and looks just as pictured. it is a bit more substantial then i expected. the details and embroidery are beautiful and make this top so uniquely retailer! it is casual in an elegant way. i will be pairing this with skinny jeans and/or white skinny pants. i cannot tell,Positive
7605,"I was so looking forward to receiving this in the mail! when it arrived, i was very disappointed. the color is more mauve than dusty pink, and the fabric is stiff and wrinkled.....not at all what i expect velvet to be (flowy and soft). the fabric seems very cheap for the price point.  i usually like floreat, but this one is headed right back to the store!",Negative
7610,"Beautiful print, however as the previous reviewer mentioned it is very sheer, much sheerer than the product shot shows. i was expecting to be able to wear a nude bra under this without a cami, however my nude bra was completely visible.
the top also ended at the middle of the zipper of my jeans, so much shorter than the tunic length shown, and the bottom half of the sleeves ballooned out much more noticeably in person (the top half of the sleeves are slim, and the bottom half are looser).

but...it didn't work for me!
i'm a smaller gal with a large chest (5'4"", 34g). i tried on the small, since it seemed so flowy and large. the sleeves were tight, yet the back of the shirt flowed way too much, making the shirt look huge on me. perhaps a more fitted back, and i would have been in love.
love the blue color!",Negative

7650,For reference i am 5'3 121 lbs and i usually wear a size 6 or 8. i got a size small and it was still at bit large. my bf said it was a nice dress to wear around the house ( like a house dress). a bit pricey for that but the way it hangs it does look like a house dress or a bit like a sack. i kept it only because i was looking for casual dresses. i wore it out and got a few compliments ( prob cuz i never wear dresses). good luck.,Positive
7653,"Nice design but very wrinkly fabric that doesn't fall well. also, as has happened to me before, retailer sent me a dress clearly worn/used and returned by someone else with hair all over it. you would think they would at least look at returned dresses to make sure that the returned clothes were free of stains and hair before they send them out.",Negative

7706,I was surprised by the other reviews. expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward. the hi-low cut with so much bulk just wasn't flattering. i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body. the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more. it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as i'd hoped. it went back.,Negative

7775,"The colors on this kimono are amazing and i really loved it, however, i too noticed the 'delicateness' of the material. it is so delicate that parts were starting to fray - including next to the kimono's label. so sad.",Negative
7777,"At first, i thought that this sweater would be too thin and show any imperfections, but it doesn't. the vertical ribbing really gives it a slimming effect and it is a perfect lightweight cover up that goes with pretty much anything.",Positive
7779,"This sweater is much prettier in person than in the picture. the colors are soft and feminine. medium fit me perfectly. this is the soft, cuddly sweater i have been looking for.",Positive
7784,"I'll start by saying the fabric and concept are beautiful. the top is sheer, but that's pretty clear in the images and not surprising for a lightweight white blouse. the problem is that the arms are more fitted and the torso (not the chest, but the mid-section) is cut fairly wide. i'm 5'10"", 140#, 34b and usually wear a 4 or a small/medium depending on how relaxed i want the fit. i purchased this in a 4. the arms were workable but slightly fitted, and the torso fit like an 8. chest was as expect",Negative
7793,It is soft and hangs great. problem - i wore it one time - and the back balled up terrible. it looked like i had owned it for years - not worn it one time. wouldn't recommend. though it is sooooo soft!,Negative
7794,"This sweater is beautiful, but is definitely more for looks than warmth. it's very soft, but very thin. i prefer the way it looks open rather than buttoned. i got the moss green color on sale, and i am glad i didn't pay full price for it--it's lovely, but certainly not worth $88.",Positive
7796,Love the softness and the length. the color was perfect. but you have be be a very skinny almost boney person for you to not show imperfections to your body. the fabric is not thick enough and does not have the give to over shadow normal imperfections. will be returning the sweater.,Negative
7804,"Really cute skirt, love that it has hidden pockets in the front. ended up just being a bit too wide on me. can't size down as fits everywhere else. will look great on someone, just not me! order true to size, fits great.",Positive
7805,Great sweater but it was just a little too short on me so it is going back. it is extremely fuzzy and soft though.,Positive
7811,"I loved this sweater as soon as i opened the package. it was soft and the colors of grey peach and white were perfect for this to were into the spring time. i am 5'3 102lbs and purchased the xs. the arm length was perfect. the sweater length hit slightly above my hips. the style of the sweater is a bit boxy, but not so much that it looks like your wearing a tent.",Positive
7817,This cardigan looked great on line but it is one of the worst things i ever ordered at retailer. the quality is awful and the material feels flimsy and cheap.,Negative
7827,This is seriously a beautiful dress. it has such gorgeous colors. it's lined so no slip needed. it is flowy and just the right length. i went with a petite and it is perfect.. can't wait to use it at the beach.,Positive
7829,"The dress is absolutely beautiful in person. the blue stripes are a bit brighter and the print on top is more muted. it's unique and sure to turn heads. being 5'2"" i tried on the small petite. this size is usually perfect (lengthwise) for me. however this dress was about 2"" too long. another complaint is the style of the top half. the model in the picture seems to be hiding the puffiness of the top half. the top half puffs out and made me appear much wider than i am. not a good look on anyone.",Negative
7831,"This may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried. the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo, absolutely garish. the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties, it just looks cheap. the skirt is an antebellum nightmare.  
i did not even want to try it on, it's that bad. i considered adding a photo, but was too horrified.
for reference, i'm 5'10"", approximately the height/ size of the model, but it was shorter than the photo depictes. i wanted to like it,",Negative
7833,"Thought this would be a great dress for warm days, but alas it fit like a sack. love floreat and have a few of their well made dresses. shame this did nothing for my curves. ordered an 8, usually wear a 10 and it was a tad narrow in the shoulders. if you can sport a loose swingy shape, this is a great dress with nice detailing, but sadly the shape did not work for me.",Negative
7838,"I love jumpsuits for their style and comfort. i loved the look of this blue silky piece, and the review that said it was like lounge wear you could wear out of the house. i agree that it is like lounge wear, but for me, there were a few challenges.

first, the fit was small. i am usually anywhere between a 2 and a 6 depending on style, cut and brand. i tried the small in this and it was not a flowy look or feel. it was restrictive in the hip area in a way that would make me not want to wear th",Negative
7839,"Don't be fooled by the photos online. the color is a bright baby blue, not pale blue. it's a beautifully designed dress, however, the material is so bulky and heavy. it's so unflattering. i was afraid to try it on and my fears came true: this dress just hung on me and pulled me down. i wanted so much to love it, but i returned it.",Negative
7843,"I found this dress to be a perfect flowy fit for the super-hot tail end of summer. this definitely is not a form fitting dress, but i bought my regular size medium (size 6) and think it fits perfectly. i have a pretty small chest and find that sometimes these a-line dresses look better if you don't have a lot on top making them ""tent out"". just my opinion. personally do not think it has an abundance of fabric. in fact, it is a lot less roomy than a lot of others in this cut due to the embroidery",Positive
7845,"I bought these to go with the boiled wool jacket that is also currently on sale. i have several pairs of charlie trousers, and i really like the brand. these are in a thicker ""winter fabric"" and i understand why the other reviews found them itchy. i don't find that bothersome, but the texture is a bit different. the quality is typical for charlies. the color stripe is a metallic bronze, but could look pink in the right light. the fabric is noticeably stretchy--i think without that stretch, these",Positive
7846,"I should have listened to previous reviewers. but the dress looks so good on the model in the two dimensional pictures. when it arrived in the mail, i realized this is a mistake. it has no shape, material is poofy and feels cheap. it is going back.",Negative
7850,"This is so close to perfect, but there's a seam down the middle of the back and they didn't bother to match the polka dots. you can see the mismatch in the second photo. i was about to buy the jacket, and totally in love, when i turned and saw the error. i hoped it was one bad match, but nope, on every one. couldn't unsee, didn't buy. very disappointed.",Negative
7852,"This tank caught my eye when it first came out couple of months ago, love the colors and the embroidery especially. the colors on top beautifu and it will complement any skin tone and the bottom is neutral so that this top will go with any bottom. this flows too goes great with skinny jeans and flats or put a strappy heels on and it's perfect for evening outings.",Positive
7853,"I am typically a small/6 in dresses, but i should have gone with the other reviewers and sized down. it had no shape, but hung like a paper sack. the armholes fit perfectly though, if i had sized down they may have been too tight. i am 5'6"" 140 lb
i will return, too bad because it is a pretty dress!",Negative
7858,"I bought these and returned them almost immediately. the material looks nice, but itchy and heavy. the fit is too small and just uncomfortable to wear.",Negative
7859,"Love the simple, casual elegance of this coat. i especially love the colors, grey & beige, because it looks great with my grey jeans as well as my dressier beige pants. i will get a lot of use from this coat.",Positive
7864,"Just got this and i haven't taken it off all night.  i feels like lounge wear, but is so cute and works with heels or flats.  throw a necklace on, a nice scarf or a jacket and dress it up for going out.  it looks exactly like the picture and fits true to size.  i will get a lot of use out of this piece for spring and summer.  nothing is better than something that feels like pjs but looks so stylish!!",Positive
7870,"Really loved this dress online and was excited to try it out. when it arrived it was heavy & bulky in the package which didn't bode well. taking it out of the bag, i was surprised at how heavy & thick it was. the picture really looks like it would be a flowy, grecian dress to throw on during a hot summer day ? but in the reality you might drown in sweat. the interior linings promised absolutely no breathing fabric.

wanted to love this as the style is very cute but was disappointed by the mate",Negative
7873,"I usually wear size 4 for dress, but this is the first time ever i have to go down to size 0, and it fits perfectly. well made, maybe a bit stiff around armholes, nothing major. i love the length as i don't like to show my knees. great color combinations, although this supposed to be a summer dress, it looks great for fall, just need to add a jacket, a pair of boots and i'm good to go, feeling pretty!",Positive
7876,"Runs true to size, with allowance for some bulky clothing underneath for those cool fall days. definitely not meant for winter - so don't plan on this for freezing cold days. the bottom falls nicely over the hips and the color is vibrant and adds some life to any outfit.",Positive
7877,"Very much in love with this ethereal, delicate dress. the silk is very light and slightly clingy, so take caution when wearing. the belt can be adjusted as modeled or you can get creative as there is length the play with. the liner finishes above the knee on me in medium petite. those of slender torsos and small busts may want to size down, otherwise tts. for reference i am 5'3"" 36dd 140#",Positive
7883,"Love, love, love this silk dress. i feel classic retailer is back! perfect for hot and steamy summer days.

just a few photos of the back, which has the belt band sewn in kind of high so that it can be wrapped through the side loops, grecian style. for some reason, in the online back photo, the model is wearing the dress backwards.

7884,"As much as i buy from retailer, this is my first review. the pictures do not accurately show how large this dress is in person. i wanted something that was a bit flowy, but this was a reminder of little house on the prairie. the most unflattering dress ever and since it's only available online, i'm not interested enough to try a smaller size.",Negative
7887,"I do not know if this item is worth the full price but i love it. very soft, good length, and comfortable to wear. the stripes are a perfect width so as not to be overpowering. the fabric design is unique and i think the weave added to the cost of production. for many it may not be worth the cost but i am glad i purchased this top. it is not a sheer fabric. try it on if you see it in the store.",Positive
7890,"As the previous reviewer stated, this wrap is over sized but that is the style. the knit is soft and dense and the metallic accents are subtle and lovely. this is an heirloom piece that will last for many, many years.",Positive

7900,This fit nicely and i loved the asymmetrical flower design. it is somewhat sheer/see through so i put a tank underneath.,Positive
7911,"This top is my new favorite. i ordered it on a whim, and oh boy am i glad!! i was so excited for it to be shipped to me, and once it arrived i couldn't wait to put it. once i put it on, i couldn't wait to show it off! it is such a great bluish-grayish color and looks great with some big hoop earrings, shorts, and sandals. such an easy, classic, simple shirt that i will probably wear too much.",Positive
7915,"This shirt is beautiful.its very light weight and great summer tee. don't hesitate to buy this, you won't be disappointed.i usually don't buy t-shirts that are quite this pricey, but i knew it might not last till it went on sale.runs a bit large and since it is linen, it will likely stretch a bit.(i have not worn it yet)",Positive
7916,This top completely fell short for me. i was so excited for it to arrive yesterday and upon opening the package i knew immediately that it was not what i was expecting. in the images online there seam up the middle of the shirt isn't even noticeable but in person it is very prominent...and not in a good way. the peplum is a lot fuller then pictured as well. did not work well with my large bust (34d). returned.,Negative
7920,"Not great quality, runs a bit lose, disproportionate (too large in neck and arms area)",Negative
7924,I ordered a size small (usually i am ps) but wanted the extra length. usually i can get away with a regular small but not this time. such a cute style but made me look short & wide. unfortunately it's going back,Negative
7928,"This top arrived today, and after trying it on, i wanted to leave a review to say that the shirt is 100% without a doubt pinned back on the model in the product picture. the fit is designed to be loose, so i don't think anyone could possibly get the same look as the model even if they sized down. i've included a picture of how it fits naturally, and a picture of how it fits the model as i hold the fabric back. it's still a cute shirt, just not the flattering top i was expecting. i'm debating on",Negative
7929,"This top looks so pretty on the model. however, the photo is deceiving as the bottom section is quite wide and loose. i am petite but between a c+ to d cup. the top is not really fitted, so my bust pushed the top out and made it look like a maternity piece. from the side it hung way in front of my body. i am wondering if this is clipped in the back on the model. if you are smaller chested and taller, this top might look nice on you. i am 5'1"", 105 lbs and c-d cup. i really loved the fabric and c",Negative
7941,"I don't normally write reviews, but this shirt was so terrible, that i felt inspired. 

first off, the seam that is in both the front and back of the shirt is much more pronounced than in the photo. secondly, there is no shape whatsoever, unlike in the photo. it bells out like a tent. it honestly looks like a shirt you would buy if you were trying to appear pregnant when not. overall, this shirt is an insult to the female form.

7942,"I was excited to see this top, ordered it and was disappointed. it was too tight across the chest and had too much fabric around the bottom. i tried this on 3 times hoping for i had been wrong in previous assessments- no luck.",Negative
7963,"Well, the model looks great and i really like interesting unusual designs as it can be really unique for very long time. i tried and when i opened package it was funny looking tent with several beautiful buttons. fits like tent, long, huge, make me look like i am on military trials and i supposed to be some sort of target.",Negative
7965,"The design of this dress was very off for my 5'4"", 120 lb, 32d frame. it's low-cut and tight in the bust, but then very voluminous and unstructured around the hips, making me look wide there. a belt didn't help much. the fabric is nice, but the overall effect of the dress was frumpy.",Negative
7973,"The photo of the mila turtleneck where model has her hands to her sides, and just below her hair, there is a bit of extra fabric which falls to the bottom of the sweater in a bit of a pleat- well, it's not representative of the abundance of fabric in the xl. i usually wear an l or xl well with retailer clothing. the excess added the appearance of excessive pounds from breasts to bottom of sweater. bummer. i'll be returning it.",Negative
7982,The tie jacket is an easy one to throw on for a casual look. it fits well to the body even better than pictured. very comfortable and medium weight so perfect for spring.,Positive
7989,This sweater is absolutely beautiful. the shape is very flattering both tied in front and in back. the wool is nice and soft and the color is a nice neutral that will pair well with anything. the stitching is a nice added detail that makes this sweater somethig special. it is a great addition to any wardrobe and i'm thrilled that it is part of mine. i can't wait to wear it!,Positive
7999,"This dress is beautiful and unique - the cutouts and lace really stand out. however, the dress was huge on me and that is rare with moulinette souers. i usually get a 0 or 0p in this brand due to the bust sizing being generally smaller but the 0 regular was huge and the armholes really big. the petite may have been better but felt that it would have been too short. while the design is beautiful, there were several areas on the dress where the threads were unraveling. for reference, i am 24 waist",Negative
8006,"I thought the sweater itself was beautiful, but found the fabric to be stiff and itchy.",Negative
8010,"This dress is really lovely. if fits and flows in a very flattering way although it is a bit long (i'm really tall so that's a very nice feature for me :p) it actually feels more linen-y than i expected to which was surprising, (i probably didn't read the product description close enough) but it was a pleasant surprise. can't wait to wear this to brunch/beach parties this summer! fair warning, it's also a little see-through - might want to wear nude underwear ;)",Positive
8012,"Love this dress! it is very flattering and makes my waist look tiny. i don't care for the hem. it isn't terrible, but i wish it was cut straight across instead of curved at the bottom. i'll probably have it altered. comfortable, great for the office.",Positive

very versatile...can wear with jeans or dress up with all black.",Positive

8039,"I got this sweater with high hopes to wear it with some leggings for christmas. it looked adorable (and long!) on the model. however, it doesn't even cover my butt, that's how short it is. if you're anything over 5'4"", i'd say it'll be too short for leggings.",Negative
8044,"My daughter bought this sweater in xs in white and i tried it on. it was a little too tight but long enough to wear with leggings so i ordered the red in a s. it just covers my butt in the back - not nearly as long as my daughter's. i still love the sweater and will wear it with jeans but it is way too short to wear with leggings. i don't understand how there can be such a difference in the same sweater - a size larger and at least 4 inches shorter! if not for that, i would have rated it a 5.",Positive
8056,"The cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but didn't flatter my shape. i think it would work better on someone very thin. the criss-cross fabric portion was a bit baggy and didn't sit right. even worse, the bust portion made me look flat (and i'm a full c cup).",Negative

8081,"Saw this in store today and had to have it. the pink is a really bright pink - definitely more of a hot pink than it appears in the image online. i am a solid 10, and i bought this in an 8, so it definitely runs a size large. highly recommend!",Positive
8087,I saw this skirt online and immediately went to the store to hunt it down.  is perfect!  one of the most beautiful items of clothing i own.  was worried the waistband would be unflattering since i'm short and curvy but it's very flattering.  can dress up or wear to the beach.  i love it!!,Positive
8088,"I purchased this in the ivory color and love it. very comfortable and agree with reviewer who said it looks good with 1 button or 2 buttoned up. my one complaint is that i found it to be such an open weave that i feel it necessary to wear a cami underneath, which is not the end of the world. the other issue i have: the back is definitely longer than the front, as pictured. i'm not sure why retailer feels compelled to have almost every top they sell have this styling, i don't think its necessary an",Positive
8102,"As the other reviewer said, the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hips-it was ridiculous. i don't know how anyone could wear it-looks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip. i'm long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well. very very strangely constructed-i couldn't keep it even at the deeply discounted price",Negative
8106,"The light red color is so rich! i would describe it as a burnt coral/red. i love the length - long enough to pair with leggings, but not overwhelming in my 5'3"" frame. one sleeve began to unravel the first time i wore it, but i was able to mend it easily and have had no trouble since. i think it was a flaw specific to my sweater and not s general indication if poor quality. hubby says this is his favorite sweater on me too!",Positive
8108,Love this pullover for its versatile style (can be buttoned or unbuttoned) and easy care look. it's casual without looking sloppy. the weave is a bit open work and can easily complement a cami or a thicker top without making me look like a stuffed sausage. the hi-lo hem on the model shots do not look that way irl. the hem is straighter. soft nubbly texture that may snag easily. got this in red and brown but wanted the sold out green too.,Positive
8115,This is the perfect fall/winter sweater. i bought it in red and i would get another one in the green color if it weren't sold out in my size. love it!,Positive
8124,"This top fits loosely through the body and a little snigger in the bust. fabric is nice but does require some ironing/steaming at times. it is a little pricey but you won't find anything similar so being unique makes it worth the cost. i ordered online but it was available at my local retailer store; unfortunately the online order didn't show availability & i would have liked to see it first since i was unsure of size ( usually wear medium if top has a relaxed fit, large if not). very cute too!",Positive

the material is very nice, soft and stretchy.",Negative

it runs large, but i should have realized the horizontal stripes sitting on the hips is not a good thing. the fur adds additional bulk where it is not needed, the hip area !!!!. i purchased a small and could have purchase a xs, but i think the problem would still be there in a smaller size. it's going back, but i am disappointed as i really wanted a something a little alternative !!!!!",Negative

8296,"I really love the idea behind this. however, the fit doesn't work for me. i'm usually a s or xs in retailer tops, and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops. this one runs small though - the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width. the neckline was very high (higher than it looks in the model photo) and the armholes were too big. so i don't think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue. the other criticism is that the front is not lined.",Negative

8750,This dress is so cute and comfortable. i'm normally a 0 or 2 and the xs is plenty roomy even though this is a clingy knit. the nice cotton under slip hides all the bumps and bulges. only worry is whether or not the loose weave will pick and how it will clean but so far i am thrilled.,Positive

8859,The yellow is not as bright as the pic and the tee shirt base color is more off white/oatmeal making the shirt look much more drab in person than in the pics. fit was ok but nothing special about this and will be returning.,Negative
8865,"Got this 4 days ago and have worn it 3 of those days. it is a perfect, beautiful autumn dress. the fabric is textured and slightly color-varied in a way that gives the black a more charcoal depth. the fabric is a thin sweater knit -- because of the texture it looks thicker than it is and i had hoped it would be thicker but i actually think if it were thicker it would not have the movement it does, nor would it be as figure-flattering. despite its thinness, it is still warm. would buy this in oth",Positive
8869,The issues the other reviewers mentioned didn't bother me as i don't have the prior years version to compare. i love the color and feel of the fabric.  a little heavier and great for early fall layering. the armholes weren't big for me but i got a small and would normally be a medium. the cut works great for a very curvy petite frame. it doesn't add bulk but does flatter a larger chest. i can see why this doesn't work for taller ladies as the pockets and hip do flare with the heavier fabric but,Positive
8872,I ordered this in blue and the color is absolutely gorgeous! i really loved it until i put it on. wow it was bad. i ordered a small--normally a sm/med due to bust but this was so wide and had so much material. it wasn't long but rather incredibly boxy. one of the most unflattering things i've ever tried at retailer.,Negative

8875,I am pleased with this skirt. the jean material is of good quality and it hangs right on my waist and hips. i ordered a 2 which left a little room in the waist to tuck in a blouse. i am 5/5 and 119. it works well for work and leisure.,Positive
8882,"I gulped when i put this in my bag during retailer days because the price was still too much but thought this has to be wonderful to charge so much, right? boy was i wrong. this is a sweater knit with a very deep v-neck that's incredibly boxy and unattractive. the knit shed all over my pants in the few minutes i had it on. i ordered in xl, having never tried this designer and that was a mistake because i generally wear large or medium. it was swimming on me. the stripes aren't as cute in real life",Negative

8892,This brand generally runs small but really this skirt is exceptionally small in the waist. i usually take an 8/10 in retailer bottoms and i had to go up to a 12! i love the details and uniqueness of the skirt. i like the shape and very much my style in a skirt. fabric is soft . i waited for sale plus promo and it was then worth the purchase. it reminds me of an old school retailer style .,Positive

9202,I bought this dress for my bridal shower and it is perfect. the pattern is beautiful and very similar to the image shown online. the fabric is much lighter than i anticipated which is nice for spring/summer weather. i had to get the top altered slightly to better fit on top but it was a very easy alteration. i am normally a size 8 in dresses and found this to fit very true to size.,Positive

9211,"I bought three -- in part, because they were on sale. i do not think that i will ever wear these without a sports bra though. they are too low in the front and on the sides for a regular bra and too thin to go bra-less. that said, they may look cute with some of the lacy-show-me bras that seem to be trendy right now. 

i am typically a small, and bought x-small. the drape is not that different in the two sizes, but the length of the straps was much less revealing in the smaller size.

9224,The fit of this sweater did not flatter my body-type. the top half did not fit well; the armpit area was loose fitting and the neckline was awkward.,Negative
9236,This cardigan caught my eye and i had no idea how soft and wonderful it would feel so it's a win-win! it hangs a little boxy so i'll need to figure out how to style it so it's more flattering. the pockets are a pretty gold color (you can see it from the inside) and adds a nice touch of color. it's a keeper!,Positive
9237,"I initially saw this sweater in the store and it really stood out. the rose pink color is absolutely beautiful and i love the glimmer band. it adds a beautiful detail to the sweater. the fabric is very soft. the only downside i see, is that lint did get all over the tank top i was wearing underneath. though i think that will change over time as i wear it more. it wasn't a huge inconvenience, which is why i still give this 5 stars. i am always a small at retailer, which is what i ordered, so",Positive

9285,Colors and patterns of this dress are beautiful and that's where it ends. cheap flimsy polyester and no lining. far too expensive for what it is. on me it bulked out in my chest area and did not look so great. i would say it runs a tad big but in my case ( i have wide shoulders) not big enough to downsize. too bad because i really love the colors and idea of this dress.,Negative

i like this dress a lot, but it would have required tailoring the skirt. i'm petite, but for whatever reason most regular sized clothing fit me well, and petites clothes are usually too short in the arms or legs for me. the midi length is better suited to taller women. in the photo it looks like it hits just below the model's knee, but on me it hit below the fullest part of my calf.

9337,Sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is. i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life. this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style. another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $5.00!!!,Negative

9610,"Love this top, the cut is nice and is similar to the previous one that was denim, love hte colors, but they looked awful on my skin tone unfortunately.

sizing is true to size, i tried on the regular size, not petite, and it was fine (my usual 0 or 2, went with 0 as tjhis top is a looser fit, 2 would be boxy). the lace part is a nice added detial, the plaid is soft flannel. color is a salmon colr, with navy, but the dominant color washed me out (i am fair). love it otherwise!",Positive

9619,"I wasn't immediately attracted to this shirt, but decided to try it on. i loved it on!
it is comfortable and very flattering. i'm a small person, and the length wasn't overbearing on me. it was full, but the stitching around the chest gives it shape and is flattering to a smaller chested person. i'm not sure how it works on a fuller person, but my guess is it may surprise you!",Positive

9649,"I so wanted to love this suit. it was gorgeous - the color, the quality, the style, but i am returning and can not recommend it. the sides need to be connected just a little bit higher and i think it would work, but there is no way you could move around in this without things popping out in front. i mean it would be gorgeous to just lay there in the sun, but i didn't feel like i could even walk safely, and i am not well-endowed. very bummed but it's going back.",Negative

so disappointing - i want my $180 back!",Negative

as to the fit, it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it, so it's good over something cute.

an unexpected purchase...i found this on my way to the dressing room.
the fit is stunning. i sized way down (i.e. normally wear 10/12, curvy, and bought a small).

11643,The print doesn't necessarily works for everybody.,Negative
11644,This top is beautiful and i really wanted to be able to keep it - i've tried it on 3 times. it is not for big-chested girls (34ddd) - it hangs like i'm 20 months pregnant because the top area lands on top of my chest. sadly this will be going back. it is beautiful and flowing and a perfect weight.,Positive
11658,"This is a crop top but super boxy and wide. i expected it to be more fitted in the waist. since it sits out away a from the body a lot, it was not flattering. i also felt the stitching to be a bit matronly for me. too bad as i am having such a hard time finding tops and i'm willing to pay full price for something that works.",Negative
11659,"I like to wear swing tops because they are comfortable, not confining. this is definitely true for this top- i have an xs and it is quite spacious and boxy shaped. this is a simple cotton shirt but the ruffle adds a nice detail, and without being too much ruffle either. great to throw on with jeans!",Positive
11665,"This fabric is the same as the turtleneck swing dress by maeve. it's lightweight and stretchy. the problem with this particular dress is the pattern in the fabric will be a little different on each dress depending on how the pattern was cut when it was made. i had to try on 5 different dresses to find one that was cut so the pattern looked and fell in the right spots when wearing the dress. hence 4 stars. the bodice is lined but the skirt itself is not. it is not see through. i'm 5'4"" and 120#.",Positive
11671,"Although the material of this top is beautiful and the quality is nice as well, it really did not lay right on me. i'm a 34d, and i got my usual size in a small. the arm holes were a bit too big, the waist was too wide and it overall looked like a bib on me.",Negative
11672,I was so excited to try these on at my local retailer. i'm so glad i did before i ordered them online because i found the fit to be totally off. the pants bulged around my hips and looked very awkward. they were also not as soft as i expected them to be.,Negative

11689,"This top is so pretty! i love the lace details and the embroidery which really makes this top something special. it's true that it is on the shorter side but that seems to be an intentional aspect of the style. i didn't find it to be too short sitting well below my waist line (i'm 5'10""). i usually wear a medium in retailer clothes and this top is no exception it fit perfectly! i know this will be one piece i wear quite often!",Positive

for the summer with sandals or converse.",Positive

12535,"These are such quirky pants! they're a lot of fun, well made and i love the wide, cropped legs. they do run small - though most reviewers say they are true to size. i wear a 4/6 or 28, and in these i had to get a size 10. very tight at the waist, even though the rest of the pant flows easily and is loose. great color, they'll be perfect for spring and fall, and you can probably pair with boots in the winter. just a fun staple to my wardrobe.",Positive
12540,"This top is beautifully made and designed.
material is soft and comfortable however it's very boxy. the details on the side stick out.
i just found it not very flattering for me.",Negative
12544,"I tried wearing it, however, i thought i needed courage to wear this tank.
unfortunately, i did not purchase this tank although i liked color and design.
first, it runs small than the regular size. 
it feels even smaller because my size is xs.
in addition, it tends to exaggerate a body line.
i am not quite sure why this happens, but maybe it is just the way this tank is.
if you are confident about your upper body posture, then yes, it would look very cool.
however, if you have thin postur",Negative
12552,"I got the small even though i usually order a medium for sweaters because i prefer them bigger and i'm glad i got the small. the sleeves are very long (which i love) and the sweater is also loose fitting (also, love). the color is gorgeous and it is thick but super soft. i wouldn't wear anything underneath it unless tucked in because the front just comes to the top of my pants. overall, it's gorgeous and i would definitely recommend this!!",Positive
12555,"This sweater was exactly what i was hoping for. it is true to size. it actually is cozy, which i love in the winter. the color is so pretty. the quality is good. it is fun and stylish. i do recommend it.",Positive
12557,Probably one of my favorite turtle neck sweaters! it looks so chic and cute on!!,Positive
12558,"When i saw this item online, i ordered it right away. loved the color and the oversized, comfy look to it. the pros: very soft,the color a deep cranberry as pictured. the cons; the low back - in the photo, the model's arms cover it up. when i put it on, it looked like an oversized flap that stuck out on the sides and was very visible from the front -- and because the material is unstructured, that made it look worse. i loved it except for this one feature, but because it was so detracting, i had",Negative
12566,"I really love this piece because it's classic and the style transitions from day-to-night. the color caught my eye first, but once i tried it on, it was knotting the tie in front and seeing the elegant texture it created down each pant leg that sold me. i felt too comfortable to be stylish, but there i was multi-tasking my full-time passions in the retailer dressing room. no big deal. 

i am a tall, size 4/6 woman. for taller girls like me who a) intend to wear a small heel with the piece",Positive
12572,"Ah! i wanted to love this but without anything under it (as pictured), the petite sizing reveals way too much side boob. i am 5'3"" and a small b cup. i ordered an xs petite. it fits but there isn't enough material under the armpits. the fabric and design is great other than this flaw. sadly returning.",Negative
12581,Fits perfectly and is quite adorable. too keep in mind is that where it's cut off on the leg is a bit awkward if you're not wearing heels.,Positive
12595,"And hits below my waist just far enough to make my thighs look enormous. i think how it fits depends alot on body type. the material is nice, color pretty, not cheap looking so i will keep it but must wear a topper to slim down thise ugly thighs of mine.....",Negative
12599,"I was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which isn't my first choice. that was the least of the problems with this jacket. i love sparkle, and i love beautiful detail, none of the elements by themselves was a problem. the sum of the parts didn't work, though. the end result was an unflattering, confusing mess. the silhouette plus the frayed edges, plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast, plus the zipper were just too many things to go t",Negative
12602,"I really wanted to love this dress, but i couldn't. it ran large and heavy. rather than a sleek cocktail dress, it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on. there was one upside: the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low, so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture.",Negative

12611,"I wanted so badly to love this dress, but i couldn't get past the thin material that you can actually see through. not for this price anyhow. the dress is shorter than i had anticipated, and more fitted around the waistline flaring out at the bottom which i feel isn't accurately portrayed in the photo. on the positive though, the color is beautiful and the neck line stunning, but alas will be returning.",Negative
12621,"I saw this in the store on a beautiful autumn saturday afternoon and was inspired for what i wanted to add to my wardrobe for the season. this blouse is just fun without being loud or overpowering. the coloration works beautifully with my wardrobe and i can wear this dressed up or dressed down; with skirts, leggings, trousers, jeans...with a vest, jacket, or sweater or on its own. it is substantial enough not to wrinkle and look sloppy, it is easy to launder and will travel well with my capsule",Positive
12623,"Was really excited for this dress and couldn't be more disappointed. doesn't look anything like the pictures.

the fabric feels...cheap. it came wadded up in a ball and is a wrinkled mess. 

looking beyond that, i tried it on and thought i had put it on incorrectly. unfortunately not. the top half doesn't sit correctly. it's so bizarre that it seems like a flaw in the design. it doesn't sit on your shoulders, but doesn't look right off your shoulders. the neckline is very high. also, front b",Negative
12626,"Great buy on sale. i wanted a foundation tee to wear under cardigans and it's great for that. perfect length, interesting, textured fabric.  i got the white in a large. fits well. a bit oversized but in a good way. stick to your normal size.",Positive
12631,"I was really looking forward to this dress. i tried it on and it does not wow like the picture. it came wrinkled, but i think even pressed it would fall weird. the side swoop falls funny, and you can see the seams underneath. and the top front falls funny, not quite sure what to do with it. it almost looks like a mock turtleneck until you fold it down. again, maybe if you get it pressed that would be better. the back is still beautiful though. i'm 5'3"" 115lbs ordered a 0.  maybe on someone talle",Negative
12640,"I agree with the other viewers that this cardigan is significantly better looking in person. i am 5'7"" 126 lbs and bought the medium. it is more fitted than how it is on the model. it keeps its shape after multiple wears and is very comfortable. i'm glad i have it!",Positive

12654,"This top is lovely and so perfect for this time of year when you want to look fall-ish but when it's still too hot to wear long sleeves. but i'm pretty sure it's navy, not black. very dark navy, yes. still, not black. compared to every other black top in my closet it looks navy. so that was a little disappointing. but i'm keeping it because i'm a sucker for a flowy top, and i can wear it right now.",Positive
12661,"I was really hopeful that this top would work on me because it is so cute online. however, i was very disappointed when i finally received it. the sleeves look soft and snuggy in the picture but are actually a bit stiff and scratchy in person. i could almost get over the sleeves, but the white part of the shirt was horrible. i am 5'10 and a size 6. i wear a size small at retailer, and i got a small in this top. the bottom of the shirt was a tad short on me and hit just below my belt line-- which i",Negative
12663,It is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion. i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordingly...this does not run small-this is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with women's apparel sizing. i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for me-very small,Negative
12670,"I was very excited to receive this dress because of the cute photo. however, upon arrival i was completely disappointed. the color is much more drab than the photo. the smudged polkadots weren't attractive. there were many little bumps and pulls in the linen. the dress is super heavy. the pleats around the waist did not lay correctly.

12697,"This dress is just very unattractive. it is quite short-waisted, almost empire and so the pockets hit in an odd place. also it is very long - midi length - and the skirt is very wide. the effect is matronly, not cute at all. size-wise it fit true to size and it is a nice medium weight denim and the construction is good.",Negative
12706,"I like the natural fiber of this dress- both the lining and outer layer are comfortable, breathable cotton. the dress has a casual contemporary vibe with the plaid weave and asymmetrical hem, but is surprisingly fitted in some areas. the bust of the xsp was too tight for me, and as a 34 b i don't usually have the problem of being too busty for my clothes. i normally wear an xsp in a dress that seems loose and flowy like this one, but this dress is more fitted than you might suspect from the webs",Positive

12718,"I purchased this in the 6p and the 8p. both fit similar, but the 6p was just a little more form fitting. the problem i have with this top is that while the top of the shirt and the shoulders are awesome, the rest of the top is pretty boxy. i am a 36c, broad shoulders. i did layer it with a longer necklace which helped deter the boxy look. if the mid section could be a little more form fitting, it would be a perfect top! soft, cool fabric, great for summer.",Positive
12722,"I love the pattern and colors of this dress. the quality of the fabric is great. i initially ordered my usual size xs, but found it a bit roomy so i ordered both an xsp and an xxs. the xxs was more fitted and the xsp was too short in my opinion. i am still on the fence about the xs and the xxs. the xxs has a tighter fit, but it is also tight in the bust and i wonder how it will be if i have to reach for something - will it be too tight? even though the xs runs slightly big, i can still work with",Positive
12725,"Every single time i was in a store, this dress caught my eye. there was never a large or xl to try on; however, so when a free shipping offer came up, i took a chance and ordered both. the xl was too large; the large was much better, but a little snug, so if it shrunk, i would have been out of luck. if i would have kept one, it would have been the large; however, they are both going back. a plaid dress sounds like a good idea for the winter when you look at it on the hanger, but on a body, it is",Negative

12733,"Like some other reviewers, i, too, have to comment on the dress's fit. the dress doesn't fit right around the bust or the waist. as a seamstress myself, i know that the problem is that it doesn't have any darts in the bust, and thus the bust and the waist are just about the same size. this dress really just needed a few of these extra hidden details to fit right. while a belt helps, i don't think it helps enough to justify the price. it's too bad--i think the concept of it is cool, and i was rea",Negative

the detailing at the shoulders is heavy, compared to the light knit of the fabric of this tee. so, it pulls the neckline forward a bit.

13259,I was thrilled to find this in a store to try it on. the fabric is light weight and the cut of the sleeves make it very unique. my only gripe is the length. it hits the very top of my pants. so if you lift your arms in any way because of the cut of the sleeves - the whole shirt lifts up and shows belly. but i loved the elegance of it so much i decided that i can live with the shortness. i will just wear a tucked in cami underneath. this fit true to size.,Positive

13481,This dress just fits weird. maybe it works for somebody..... there is a reason it has been put on sale...,Negative
13488,"This is not even a dolman style sweater because it's loose fitting everywhere around the arm. the point of a dolman sweater is that the sleeves are fitted around the wrist/forearm, but this is not the case with this sweater. it's super loose around the wrist area - i can fit both of my wrists into a sleeve.",Negative
13496,This top is lovely! high quality yet delicate material and is the perfect weight to transition to autumn. the top is oversized yet flattering. paired with leggings it will be the perfect travel outfit for my upcoming trip. i can't wait to wear it over and over again!,Positive

13510,"I was so excited to order this sweater. i thought that the moss color would make it a great basic for work or casual days. ordering it on sale made it all the better. however, when it came i was so sad to see how muted the colors were, with little definition. the sweater itself lacks definition as well, just shapeless and hangy. i also did not expect the angora like hair on the sweater which bothered by eyes as soon as i tried it on.",Negative
13514,"This sweater is absolutely gorgeous! the green is a lovely, rich shade and the material is wonderfully soft. i love the slightly slouchy fit, but it's far from looking shapeless. i bought my usual size small (5'8"", 140, straight athletic build, size 4/6) and i love it casually paired with boyfriend jeans and ankle boots or a little elevated with a skinny and heels.

i'm so happy to have tracked it down in our local store, i'd buy them all if there was more in stock!",Positive

13517,"Just purchased this in the lilac color in the store in my usual xs size. the cut and shape are very flattering, with the waist sitting lower than my natural waist. in person, the color looks very different than on the website. it is more a lovely neutral taupe to me. one thing is that the snap at the neck is placed about one half inch off in order for the neckline to lay flat. since this jumpsuit is so cute, i decided that this is an easy fix i can do myself.",Positive
13519,"I ordered this online and was so excited to try it! unfortunately it didn't work for me. maybe its the style but i had issues with the fit. maybe i'm too long waisted, it just didn't seem to fall properly. i liked the fabric, loved the length, could see getting a lot of use from this. i would definitely recommend trying it on!",Positive
13520,This dress has a great shape and fabric - but the v neckline is too deep/low and the arm holes are also cut too low. would loved to have been able to keep it but had to return.,Negative
13522,"This is a really nice quality dress. it is a low-cut v-neck but the fabric is form fitting so its not revealing when u move. i love the top part of the dress but the skirt just did nothing for me. it's a soft material but the skirt almost resembles a bath towel in look and feel. i am petite in size (5'0"" 100lbs). i will be returning due to the skirt being to loose on me in width rather than length. also, the center pleat of the skirt makes it look a bit odd. the skirt hit right at knee height.",Negative
13534,"This is the widest sweater i have ever seen. i laughed out loud when i opened it, and then showed it around my office and everyone else cracked up too. it is comically wide. 

even when i was 9-1/2 months pregnant, the m/l would have been pretty roomy on me. now that i'm back to about a size 10-12, this looks like jared from subway's pre-weight-loss pants, in sweater form. ridiculous!",Negative

13546,"I grabbed my typical size (8) and found it fit snug in the bust. the fabric has plenty of stretch, so the snugness was fine, especially because it meant there was no gaping along the neckline in the front. it's lowcut, but i didn't feel particularly exposed. i ended up not buying it because i don't think it fit my body right. the distance between the top of the shoulder and the bottom of the arm hole was too long for me - a significant portion of my bra was exposed at the bottom of the arm hole",Negative
13548,This top is very airly and swingy.  definitely need to wear skinny jeans to off set the volume on top.  it is a pretty top and also unique so i kept it.,Positive

13556,"This dress is gorgeous in person. it is so much softer than it appears the photo and the fabric moves well. what you can't see from the picture is that the bodice sort of overhangs the skirt by an inch or so which is really nice for accentuating a small waist and separates the top from the bottom in a cool way. 

i am 5'6"" 135 lbs and curvy. 36-26-39 for reference. i ordered the 4 and it is loose although still flattering thanks to the forgiving cut. wish i had gotten a 2 but now they are sold",Positive

13563,"I saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase. then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different, but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money! look at the top, the stripe colors are different. and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well. and the dress was short on me and i'm two inches shorter than the model. bummer.",Negative
13565,"This dress reminds me of a fabric used for curtains. it is sturdy beautiful and strong. i looked like a large picture window in it. if i was 5'10"" and 120 pounds it may have worked ?",Negative
13566,This is a sweet top as it is shown. on the model it appears there is a panel behind the lace on the front of the top. this is not so-the entire front of the top is see through. one would need to wear a camisole. the material on the blouse is very sheer-it appears to be rather cheap actually. if you are wearing a top this sheer it does not make sense to have a camisole on underneath. that said you are going to be able to see your bra and skin down to your belly button if you do not have a camisol,Negative
13567,I was worried at first that this dress might make me look like a circus tent but it is actually incredibly flattering. also super comfy! first day wearing if i got compliments from friends and strangers!,Positive

13579,"This dress looks cute online, but it is enormous. i bought a small, but it looked more like a 3x plus size. i tried it on, just in case, and honestly it looked like a great dress for a clown. this dress must have had two feet of fabric pinned behind the model in the photo.",Negative
13580,"Loved everything about this top except two things: the price (there is a lot of pretty detail though) and the shoulders. what is not depicted in the stock photos is how wide the shoulder ruffles are...i have an athletic build at 5'7"", 140 lbs and 32dd and this top unfortunately made me look like a football player. i ordered a small and the fit was perfect. beware that this top is on the shorter side. it really is very pretty but i would steer away if you have athletic or broad shoulders.",Positive
13581,"I've been eyeing this dress for months, so when it went on sale i finally purchased it. now i see why it's on sale.
the dress runs extremely large and has no shape.... looks like a potatoe sack and i feel like moo...moo in it!
this will be going back to the store!!!!",Negative
13582,I love this long knit skirt! it is great for any of the cooler seasons! it has a lovely somewhat a-line look when you have it on. the knit is a light weight but has a nice feel to it. true to size. i love the length to pair with tall boots!,Positive
13586,"I had high hopes for this top based on the photos, but when it arrived it is a very thin cheap feeling top. the color is a dusty rose color that has a yellowish mottle throughout it, almost like a tie dye or slub effect.  not pretty at all.",Negative

13597,Great color. great length. will go perfect with leggings and skinny jeans/pants. this will work well when the weather transitions and will be super cute under a cardigan when it gets cold.,Positive
13598,"The title says it all. while the quality was good, when i put this dress on a felt like i was wearing a shapeless sack fashioned out of wallpaper. the length was longer than on the model (makes sense since i am only 5'5""), which was ok, but the overall fit was just too big. i am a size 2 and tried the xs, which was huge. just not flattering or breezy or sexy in any way. going back!",Negative
13600,"Man, this dress is the worst. i don't understand how it looks the way it does on the model. agree with previous reviewer - there must be a minimum of 200 pins pulling the waves and waves of extra fabric back. this dress looks so cute , but is so, so, so disappointing in person. sweater collar and cuffs - stiff and bulky. dress - billowy and sack-like - not sure how they got a belt to pull it all in. save yourself the return and do not get sucked in by the sale price and extra sale discount like",Negative

13605,"So disappointed. i love retailer! this was a huge disappointment. i am 5'3"" and 120 pounds. when i put it on, all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look. if i wasn't so disappointed, i might have laughed. this had to have been a design mistake. i've truly never seen something so unflattering.",Negative
13607,Such a great dress. fit is flattering. the small v cut in the front and beading around the neckline keep it from becoming a boring lbd. classy enough to wear to a funeral but can be dressed up with some killer shoes. thrilled with purchase!,Negative
13615,"Easy, fun and flattering. fits tts. i normally wear a m/l or 10/12. i ordered a large and it fits well. the tie at the back lets you wear it as tight or loose as you want it. the length is good for my 5'9 frame.",Positive
13616,I wasn't expecting to love to this dress as much as i do.  the length and horizontal stripes (petite was sold out and my torso is square) are automatically two strikes but the sale-on-sale price was begging me to give it a go.  so glad i did!  the cut and flare are flattering.  the self to tie is slimming and can be styled different ways.  the regular length is doable when i wear platform wedges.  the colors scream summer and vacation fun.  my only problem is the feel of the fabric--liner is fin,Positive

13666,"Long-time ag jeans fan. lately though, i'm finding the material is much too stretchy. i wanted a good pair of jeans. if i wanted pajama jeans, i would've ordered them. i found the same thing with the steve capris i ordered (same review there).

it's a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted. if only they had been made out of actual jeans material.",Negative

they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly see-through as it is so thin, therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants - great - i would not leave the house in them... or turn over in bed in them.

when i sit, the slits fall down around my thighs. my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way",Negative
13680,Bought the dress online and it only has an eye and hook at the top. the waist has no stretch and their isn't a zipper. you have to be a contortionist to get it over your head and shoulders. so cute in the pic but not realistic. going back.,Negative

13694,"I was skeptical about the contrasting color details on this blazer, and it turns out i was right to be. this blazer just looks like part of a prep school uniform, both in the colors and the fit, which is very boxy. maybe this is someone's style, but i just don't think it looks good.",Positive
13697,"Tried both colors....gorgeous, but kept the white as it offers more versatility in my wardrobe. happened to have an retailer cami that follows the lines of this top exactly to help conceal how transparent it is.

13701,"Great fabric, not too clingy and provides a forgiving sillhoette. very comfortable. perfect skirt for summer get togethers or shopping. may be a little long if you are on the short side. one thing i liked is that the skirt draped well and doesn't hang open or slide up. recommend particularly on sale.",Positive
13706,I love this t-shirt! it's a little bit dressy because of the lace but the t-shirt material is great for casual wear. i tried on the white but ended up buying the black because the white is so sheer. i'll still have to wear a layering tank with it but the black just feels less sheer for some reason. really cute and nice quality t-shirt!,Positive

13723,"I wanted to love this dress so much so that i ignored earlier reviews and purchased it in two sizes to see if i could make it work. the fabric is gorgeous, but the fit was very unflattering. it's too large on top and hangs awkwardly in both sizes. i considered tailoring to make it work but with this pattern i felt like that would be a compromise. in the end i returned both sizes ast the fabric couldn't compensate for the very unflattering fit.",Negative
13728,"Fit tts, very flattering and slimming with fitted thighs and slight flare. can be dressed up given the beautiful and classy dark wash. the hint of stretch makes them super comfortable. the only thing is, they are very long, will have to hem unless you are 6 ft tall. in my 5'5 case i'm afraid the hemming will take away some of the flare effect. ag, please make pants with realistic length! still, very happy, especially since i was lucky to get my size during a promo.",Positive

14969,Ordered a size medium as i usually take a medium in retailer coats- the wool is wonderful however the stripped bands are sewn into the fabric which add to the weight. the coat has an odd shape - not a line or straight. the medium was large on me. the bottom edges of the coat did not line up when buttoned and there was no inside hook or button to help even out the bottom edges. sadly this coat will be returned.,Negative

16401,I bought this sweater and love it! one of my favorites this season.,Positive
16402,The dress is very comfortable but runs a little big. i normally wear a 4/s and the small fits but doesn't have great shape. i'll keep it and wear with flip flops casually but was hoping it could transition out too. it's just not as fitted as it would need to be,Positive
16408,Fits and lots nothing like picture. very wide like a tent dress!,Negative
16410,"I found this skirt ran very small and i had to go up a size from what i usually wear. maybe it is meant to be worn really tight as the fabric seems to contain a lot of spandex. i really like the longer length. it feels like a good sturdy fabric. i haven't washed it yet, but i'm hoping it doesn't fade or shrink.",Positive
16419,This is definitely true to size. i tried both the small and medium on in the store and the small was too tight( this is meant to be a little looser like a tshirt) the medium was spot on. not too tight and not too baggy. i think it's a fun go to piece that can be worn with a jean jacket and sandels or booties. it looks like denim too which i wasn't expecting. way better in person!,Positive
16427,"So cute! rompers are hard because they are so cute but rarely work for all body types. this one is so super cute. the material is so soft and comfy, feels silky. i got a small and fits perfect. i'm 5'4"" and 117lbs so it runs very true to size when most clothes from retailer run big. i love rompers but only have one other one. this is by far my favorite! i can't wait until it's much warmer and i can wear it all the time.",Positive

16446,"I tried this on today and it was awesome! great color, great fit, thin summer material but not too thin that it was see through. the slits added a really nice design to this dress, very slimming. my problem is the deep v in the front. for small busted women this might be a deal killer. for me in the xs the v hung even below my boobs, no cami could fix that. unfortunately, cloth and stone tend to make their shirts and dresses with too deep a v, it's always disappointing for me because i love thei",Positive

16460,"Love this top! tried it on in store...so glad i did since it runs large and i had to size down to a medium. the color is a beautiful camel and the material is soft...very grateful the fabric content did not contain dreaded wool, lol! therefore leaving it soft and comfortable to wear...the price tag was a bit much considering it is only a sweater vest but with retailer price equals quality so i don't mind spending the extra $!",Positive
16462,"Loved this shirt when i saw the picture. unfortunately fit was not what it needed to be to keep it. you can't really see in the photo but if you have any chest at all (i am only 34b...so would say of average size bust) this shirt will not fit well. there is a seam in the bust area that cuts across the bust which is not flattering/doesn't fit well . the sleeves were also a bit more tight than i'd have thought from the photo.

16473,"I initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model. it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant. then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders. i'm regularly a size 2/xs, 32d and 120 lbs and both size 2 and 4 did not work for me.",Negative
16476,I looked at this dress for a long time before i purchased it because of the money. i wear a size 2p. was entirely disappointed in the style and construction of this dress. for one thing the lining is bulky and you could never wear it in warmer weather without burning up. the dress as pictured looks very feminine and light weight silk but there is just too much material going on--- thick and heavy. the overall fit was too big and very unflattering.,Negative
16478,Received this in the mail today and was disappointed. i typically wear a 6/8 but bought this in the 8 as i had purchased another similar top from the same company in an 8. this does not fit the same at all. the top pulled in my shoulder and chest area while had ample room in the body. needless to say i will be returning this item,Negative

16491,"Beautifully made shirt however the sizing is way off. the sleeves and across the chest are really tight while the rest of the shirt fits fine. if you get a size larger then the shirt in the body is to large. would recommend if you have really tiny shoulders, arms and chest. such a shame since i really love the shirt.",Negative

also- the sz 10 is what was tight - and i usually wear a sz. 4 or 6, or small-size top/blouse.
in the end, this wasn't very flattering as it looked more like a maternity top.",Negative
16495,"I was obsessed with this top. i ordered my normal 4 and was bummed about the fit in the shoulders. the slight puff was too far in, it didn't hit on my shoulder. so i returned it to a store and ordered a 6. it came quickly but it was still too narrow in the shoulders. i took it to the store and held it against the 4 and the seam was the same length between the neck and shoulder as the 4. both returned. i had no hope for an 8.",Negative

on. too bad, but it went back",Negative
16499,The fabric is great. the design is fun. i thought the dress would be perfect for work and also wear for a fun night out. the fit was perfect up top but the bottom part was to full and a lot longer then i expected. so i had to return it.,Negative

16503,I have no idea why this has bad reviews! how is there any left?! this is a beautiful piece that i had to have in both the navy and green. i love that it comes with a cami. it&#39;s very flattering and not too wide or boxy. the lace detail is amazing! i bought my usual size and it fits perfect. love this top!!,Positive

16519,This is a great up-to-date twist on a must-have staple - a black (or grey) cardigan. easy flowing and flattering style and warm enough for fall weather.,Positive
16521,I tried this on in the store and almost considered buying it until i looked at the price tag. i think it's unique and interesting. i just don't think it's worth the $$$. the fabric is nothing special and the construction is not complicated enough to warrant the cost. i would consider it on sale. retailer has more interesting sweaters made with softer blends for a similar price - all things considered i don't think it's a smart purchase.,Positive
16523,"This has such awful proportions. i'm 5'0 and 100 lbs, ordered xxs petite (in the neutral color). the seam at the bust literally hits in the middle of my bust!! it looks very unflattering, and it's very pronounced. i'm only 5'0 and already the seam hits at such a high point on me. below the seam the sweater is all scrunched up where it's sewed, and it balloons outward and is very square from there down. very shapeless sweater and not flattering at all unless you have your arms by your sides to hi",Negative

the sweater is high quality, and the colors are perfect. the fit needs work.",Negative

16545,"Hahaha..this dress is hilarious! it looks nothing like the image! i am usually a 0/xs, and 4 was the smallest size available, so i ordered it. when i opened it, it felt like 10 lbs of fabric. i thought maybe i ordered a size way too big, until i could barely squeeze into the top of the dress. once i looked in the mirror, i almost fell over laughing. the rest of the dress is huge. i don't believe this dress would be flattering on anyone.",Negative
16558,"The design is very strange. the inner slip is quite form-fitting, but the dress on top was just massive, like a sack. on the sides were tassels that i could not figure out what to do with. they looked weird just hanging off the side, so i tried to knot them like a belt. overall, this dress was not attractive on. it looks much better on the model. the coloring on the snakeskin print dress is also different in real life, harsher red, blue, and white print not the dusty rose and plum pictured.",Negative

16859,After reading the previous reviews i thought sizing down would be a great idea. as soon as i pulled it out of the bag i knew that the xs/s was still wayyy too big. for reference i am 5'3 and a 34ddd and usually wear an 8 but this thing was enormous. it was shapeless and boxy but done so horribly it looked like i was pregnant. it has an adjustable draw string at the bottom which helps to make you look like a balloon. such a disappointment. the design was lovely and it looked very high quality and,Negative
16861,"This dress hits flatters the whole body. love the three quarter sleeves, love the relaxed fit of the bottom half. love how it is fitted, body conscious around bust. super flattering. the teal color is particularly gorgeous. a color that would suit a lot of different skin tones. this is a no-brainer dress that you will reach for in your closet every single time.",Positive
16862,"This looks great on the model but when it arrived, i couldn't believe it was the same jacket. it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it. i really wanted to like it, but even the xs/s was too baggy. also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isn't actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry.",Negative

16962,"Like the other reviewers, i opted for the grey version. almost every tunic dress i've tried winds up looking like a sack when it's on my body, so i was very pleased when this dress looked pretty great. the neckline is perfect - nice depth and addition of on-trend lacing - and the length (love the shirttail hemline) is also perfect. the drape of the material keeps it from looking like a shapeless bag. my only comment #and it's quite minor - i'd give this 4.5 stars if i could) is that the pockets",Positive
16978,"I usually wear a medium, and this jacket was no exception. the jacket is a shorter style as pictured. it is still flattering, even though it is a little boxy. i got the grey, which is a dark gray/slight greige color. if you like edgier over boho, this is a cute transitional jacket.",Positive
16979,Love the tegan tunic version of this dress. i assumed since it looked identical except for the length that the sizing was the same but i was wrong. this runs so big! i got a s in the tegan but the s in this dress looked like an oversized potato sack on. i highly recommend ordering at least 2 sizes down unless you want to look tent-y.,Negative

- tts. i ordered the medium for my 36c, 5'9"" frame and found it sufficient.

17322,"These pants fit tts and are ask pictured in length on me (5'5""). i can go between a 4 and a 6, and tried the 6 and they were fine. that said, the fabric completed turned me off. it is that sort of stretch fabric with a sheen to it. i did not find them to be the wonderful wardrobe basic i thought they'd be- the fabric is just too stiff, and the sheen made them feel cheap, unfortunately.",Negative

17327,"I'm a tunic girl--have to admit that. for me this top is fab.  i love roomy, swingy tops and this is exactly that. as others have mentioned, it is quite roomy at the bottom, however the weight of the fabric is so light it lays very nicely.  i love how it fits in the arms. i hate when arms are too big. the sleeve fits snugly. for reference i am 5'5"" 140 lbs. the small fit perfectly. i have already worn several times to work. perfect in the a/c.",Positive

17347,I had high hopes for this top but once again it is just a big boxy too much material top. i get the style but if it adds 10lbs to your middle area its not for me. it is a thin material so it does hang nice.,Negative
17349,You can't go wrong with these pants. as other reviews point out when they say skinny they do mean that this is a skinny fit so order accordingly. i ordered a 4 when i have been wearing 2s in many other styles and was glad for the 4. i thought the fabric was all season so don't agree with some other reviewers regarding the stiffness of the fabric. i think it's perfect. everyone is different. these are pretty close to year-round wearable.,Positive

17418,Love this top! i get compliments on it every time i put it on! it dresses up a pair of jeans perfectly!,Positive
17420,This sweater is thicker than some of the other cashmere sweaters i purchased at retailer this year. it is made with high quality cashmere as it is extremely soft. i wouldn't describe it as chunky or bulky though. it's probably made of at least 2 or maybe even 3 ply cashmere. the sleeves do run slightly short. i purchased the xs and it fits my petite frame perfectly! grab it while you can! it's so luxurious & super warm for the winter.,Positive
17421,"I ordered this top in a 14, my usual size, and it fits fine, but it is way too short-waisted! it looks nothing like what the model is wearing. her top comes low on her waist, almost to her crotch area. mine was just about 2 inches below my belly button! it was almost as if they accidentally cut off the lower half of the top at the factory! very strange.",Negative

17435,"I was debating getting a large in this top but went for the medium, boy is it huge, the jersey fabric is quite thick which makes the sleeves bulky and uncomfortable, even the small would be giant! 
for reference i normally wear a size 8/10 my chest is 34 e and this was just so so huge, it hung so badly of my chest that it looked frumpy and made me look bigger than i am.

17472,Weird fit and the tie just add to the problems. i think i'd like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie. the tie seems like an after thought. it's flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house -- no matter there size. i ordered a medium black and it's already in the mail!,Negative

17487,This jacket is a great buy at the sale price. drape is wonderful and the weight is nice; lightweight and will transition well from summer to fall. the adjustable ties at the waist make it very flattering on a curvy figure. i purchased the white and am going to purchase the black as well. definitely recommend.,Positive
17488,"This jacket is pretty cute in person. it is a nice thick gauzy material. the black is more like a dark washed gray color. while i do like the jacket, i feel like it is cut a little wide... maybe i should have ordered a size down. i usually wear a combination of 6s and 8s and am usually between a small and medium. i ordered this in a medium, but there was quite a bit of extra fabric at the sides and in the shoulder area. i'm returning the jacket for now, but might reorder in a small another time.",Positive

17568,I loved this dress. the details in the embroidery are gorgeous and reminds me of another holding horses dress i own. what didn't work out is its a swing design but the fabric is thick and doesn't swing well. it's white and makes one look a bit heavier because of the generous cut. this could work on a tall person but on my short frame it didn't work.,Positive

17574,I'm not sure why the other reviewers think that this runs small. in my opinion it runs pretty large. i am normally a medium and i ended up returning the medium to get the small. i do have a small bust (36b) and skinny arms so maybe that's why? regardless it is super cute and i think it can be dressed up or down. it looks awesome with the pilcro jean jacket!,Positive

17636,This top is very cute...on other people. i ordered my normal size (xs) and just did not work out. it's very billowy on the bottom (too much for me) and the top portion did not lay right. the material is thin so you will need to wear a cami underneath it. perhaps if i got the petite xs that right have been a better fit...not sure. in the end the top went back.,Positive

19903,This dress was really odd. i loved the quirky mixture of the blue stripe and the floral but that's about it. the shape was unflattering but honestly that could be because this dress ran large. i was just very underwhelmed with this dress. also the hidden button zipper at the front was an amazing idea but not the best execution. overall its okay just hated it on me.,Negative

19920,Just gorgeous . this is one beautiful top. the colors are pretty and vibrant. i wear either a large or xl and the large was great in this top. dress it up or down.this top flows and it drapes beautifully in the back. it looks fantastic with jeans. as a bonus it is lined so no need for any type of piece under it. it's an all year round top. throw a cardigan or wrap over it when the weather cools down and you are set to go. a great top for your wardrobe . i would not hesitant to buy it.,Positive
19933,"I wanted these jeans so badly! i originally ordered them in my regular size -a 27. they were too big even for a tomboy fit, so i ordered a 26. the size 26 order was backordered and then cancelled. i am so sad! i would absolutely buy these if i could get them in my size. they are so soft and beautiful. i love ag's quality.",Positive
19937,"Very pretty and delicate top. it is fresh and with a delicate embroidered ""bib"" style. the fabric on the front is silky and the back is a blend of silk and cotton, just that part (the back) could be a little thicker so more durability. still as it is, it's a niece piece and good quality.
i find it you can wear it with dress pants for office or formal gathering and to dress up jeans and either to leave it our or tuck in. since the bib is focal point you can skip any necklace and war dainty earrin",Positive

19945,"I tried this on in my regular size and was able to get it on fine, but the cup portion of the suit was just crazy! with the straps tied tightly around my neck, it was like the cups just flipped out and open. i am a regular b cup, and i don;t think it was sizing (though i did not have the opportunity to try multiple sizes). the cup did not right and, for this reason, would make this absolutely impossible to wear. unfortunate, because the design is so pretty.",Negative
19946,"On me, thsi was ginormous, looked like a mu mu. it is pretty, but there was just too much fabric, even in the smallest size. the quality seems nice, and it looks pretty, but overwhelming. i will say, i think it would work on tail lean people, i have pretty muscular shoulders, so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look 30 pounds heavier, no joke. fabric is soft though. give it a try, just not for me...

19948,"This is a well made and nice looking top.the gathering around the neck adds to the overall look of the shirt, but it also affects the way it fits. i got my usual size medium and it was tight in the shoulders and arm holes. i regret that i had to send it back.",Positive
19958,I am usually a size o and ordered and xs ...due to the band in the center (not much give) it was a little difficult to shimmy over my hips but the body fit perfectly when i got passed that part. that being said the cup design is a hot mess. i am a b/c cup size and the top on this could not handle it. i felt fully exposed. i thought maybe if i went a size up i could get a little more coverage. the body felt ok on the small but the cups were still just too small. i still felt to exposed. they are,Negative

19968,"Loving this top! feels comfy and casual like a sweatshirt, but pairs great with a pencil skirt or dress pants to wear to work. easy to dress up and down and i get so many compliments on it! it's fraying a tiny bit on the front, but i think that adds to the not-so-precious vibe. i'm 5'10"" 160# and the m works great!",Positive

20029,"Even in my usual petite small size, this looked bulky and made me look stumpy. disappointing because the style looks so good in the picture and the material looks to be good quality. i don't even know if going down a size would have helped. as others have mentioned it looks like a frumpy house robe.",Negative

20034,Bought the gray and peach in the store and loved it so much ordered the other colors online. this top is very comfortable and stylish. it stands out from the crowd as just enough different to be very unique and trendy but still a classic look. the sweater front is very soft and the back has a bit of a silk feel but not sheer. i also like that the back is a bit longer than the front.,Positive
20037,"Corduroy fabric is historically difficult to fit well....even with stretch added. so imagine my surprise when i tried on the pilcro serif mid-rise corduroy pants in the saffron yellow shade and they fit great! they were long enough as well. i loved them so much that i ordered the aqua shade as well and when that pair arrived, it fit just a nicely as the yellow ones. how wonderful that there is finally a corduroy pant that truly fits well. these are not old lady pants either...how nice!",Positive

so short!!
is this to be in keeping with the ankle pant trend??
anyone who wants a shorter pant could easily hem them. but there is no way to lengthen them.
i held the new pants up to an older pair from previous years. they are a full 2 1/2 inches shorter! wow!

20060,"I am a sucker for a peasant dress. i love anything i can toss with a pair flats and head out the door, but this dress is ridiculous. i look like a schoolmarm. the white bib collar takes this dress into costume territory. i love one september and have many items from the brand that i wear regularly, so i'm bummed that this wasn't what i expected. i knew it would have flow, but it's more billowy than i wanted. stay away unless you want to look like a little girl on the first day of school.",Negative
20066,"This piece fits true to size and is very flattering on. sometimes i worry about my stomach not being perfectly flat, but this wasn't an issue at all, probably because of the intricate lace details. the fabric is substantial enough that i don't feel like it'll get a hole in it after multiple wears.",Positive
20069,"Such an adorable top. very flattering despite it's rather full style. just be sure you get the correct size since it does indeed run quite large. i normally wear a small, sometimes medium. i ordered both sizes to be sure but they were both too large! i sized down to xs and that fit perfectly.",Positive
20074,"I love this top!! it is flattering in all the right places. i struggle with shirts the are too flowy however this is forgiving yet looks more fitted and flattering. i bought the shirt in blue and am buying it now in red! i typically buy a large or xl, in this shirt a large is perfect!",Positive

20087,"Usually wear s and xs, tried this in s at store but the sides were still lumpy after zipping the size zipper up. if i tried xs it would have looked better but may be bit too tight. the sides of the arm holes were also cut very low. it also has a dusty grey sheen to it that makes it look like old velvet in a bad way. two layers, green on outside, and a polyester beige layer underneath.

but definitely a showpiece that can be paired with a short jacket.",Negative

20107,"The shirt is beautiful, but fits much too small. the stitching limits the space in your shoulders, and the hem too short. a petite frame would be able to pull this off- but i am a 5.10"" medium, and the shirt didn't work in every direction.",Negative

20120,I always look at jumpsuits but they never seem to work for me because of my height (5'1) and petite stature. i ordered the xxsp and it fits perfectly! so comfortable and made of high quality silk which you can really feel is well made. love that there is no zipper- just a hidden elastic tube top and a hook and eye below the nape of the neck. plan on wearing this for my 30th birthday with heels or booties and a cropped leather jacket!,Positive
20128,"I'd been waiting to snatch up this jumpsuit as it looks so cute online, so when it went on sale i ordered it right away. well i was thoroughly disappointed. i agree with some of the other reviewers, the fit is odd, huge on top and too snug on the bottom. being made of flimsy silk it has no give and didn't hang well on my curvy body, being too loose in some areas and too snug in others. also the top is embroidered while the bottom isn't. the material is thin and and it definitely isn't high enoug",Negative
20129,The picture doesn't do these justice! they are beautiful and a must-have for summer date nights. i am 5'2 and hover between 115-120. i tried on the regular size in-store and they were way too long. so i ordered the xs petite and they fit perfectly! i like to pair them with a flowy top that hangs over the waist band. (not styled like the pic). they literally feel like you are wearing nothing. you'll receive so many compliments - trust me!,Positive
20132,I really like this top. perfect underneath cardigans or on its own. the fabric is a bit thin so light colors may be see through. love the wider style so there is no bra show. versatile. i see myself purchasing more of these!,Positive
20133,"This item is pretty, the print on the fabric is nice and reminiscent of embroidery, but only the top portion has a few embroidered accents. my issue with it is it's very impractical. the fabric is extremely thin, and you wouldn't want to wear it in any weather below 75 degrees. it's ridiculous to advertise this product for a fall/winter season. the tube top underneath doesn't work very hard to stay up, and isn't a very practical way to hold up the jumpsuit (why wouldnt they just stitch a lining",Negative
20134,"This dress is absolutely stunning! the colors are vibrant and it flows very nicely touching the floor. 
 it runs very small, i ordered size medium and i could not even zip the dress, i normally wear size 10. i had to return it and order again in size large. i love the fit this time!! but be aware if your normal size is higher than 10 this dress will not fit and larger sizes are not available for this dress. it is nice addition to my wardrobe and i am planning to wear it to the multiple occasion",Positive

20745,"This skirt is classic, very high quality and even better in person. it runs true to size. the material is slightly thick and will be great for fall, winter and early spring. my only complaint is, i wish it had pockets. i love tracy reese designs. i can't wait to wear this for thanksgiving.",Positive
20750,"So disappointed in the abundance of polyester fabrics that retailer carries these days. especially at this price point. the pattern and style of this dress is beautiful, but i will never spend two hundred dollars (or even half that) on a poly dress. please add more linen, cotton, and silk!",Negative
20770,"After reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale. i'm tall and lean, but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures. firstly, the top has a strange transition to the skirt, with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together. if you blouse it and lay flat, it invariably gets bunched as you wear it. this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks, creating less clean lines. i also found the blue, black",Negative

i'm 5'4"", 126 pounds and generally wear a size small, but the small of this dress looked more like a maternity outfit on me. it squeezed the bust a bit too much, and left open some of the areas just under the arms that could probably have used a teensy bit more coverage to be truly flattering.",Negative

20874,"Alas, i so wanted to love this. the photos of the models wearing it look gorgeous -- flowy, drapey, ultimate grecian goddess. but it just doesn't work unless you're super-skinny. too much material. almost bulky; strange looking. the print is so beautiful -- i love the pink floral, and i love the whole idea of the dress. but it just doesn't work. have to send it back.

20877,I'm so glad i trusted my instincts and decided not to size down on this luxurious dress since my body type is so different from the previous reviewers.  size small would have surely cut off my circulation around my shoulders.  i bought mp since i have thick arms/shoulders/back and i'm short 135# 38-27-35.   my only gripe is how skinny and insubstantial the straps are so maybe i'll get those changed.  i'm tempted to buy the other color since this dress is so beautiful but i really don't nred it!,Positive
20880,I purchased this in the black in an xl. i am typically a 14-16 dress size and i would say this runs tts with a flowing fit on the bottom. the top is fitted but has some stretch to it. absolutely gorgeous fit and quality. i love this so much i want to purchase the teal color. a spring must have!!!,Positive
20890,"Wow, wow, wow! this is so retailer! the dress is more breathtaking in person, it is a beautiful work of art from top to bottom. the fabric is super soft and flows perfectly. the lining is super soft as well, and it doesn't fall all the way down to the hem so that the burnout detail would show through on the bottom. i don't like spaghetti straps but the straps are very sturdy and high quality, very comfortable. fyi, the color is much richer (a shade darker) in person, like an eggplant color. i orde",Positive

such a shame. this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me.",Negative

20942,The color is completely off! i loved the way this vest looks in the picture! i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment. it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture. very pale. horrible.,Negative
20952,"This blouse is just so beautiful! but i do love white blouses, so that may influence my enthusiasm. however, once i buttoned it up, it was just dreamy. i have a long torso and am tall for a typical xs, so it's often hard to find something that's the right length. this is perfect! it may overwhelm some ladies who are on the petite side of height, but it's a rare find for me. paired with a pair of cropped pants because i'd come in a dress, it looks delightfully vintage in the best of ways. i'm sti",Positive

21311,Really wanted to love...but...the way it fit..lower part a tad too flowy...almost maternity like to hide a belly and the top area feels like my chest is being smushed! despite my bra size being a modest 36b...the look it gave was square on top almost block like with bottom that had flare...such a pretty top unfortunately the overall design just didn't work me.,Negative

21445,This tee is very pretty - i purchased it in the grey/purple combo. i usually wear a medium in this brand just because i don't like my tees to be fitted but i found this one to be a little too loose for me so i should have sized down to a small.,Positive

i tried on both the medium and large (i'm between sizes, 5'4"", 34g) and preferred the large. the medium waist rode up a bit on my torso, so the large stayed down a bit. also, the medium pleats did not fall as nicely on my chest.",Positive

22403,This is a great winter addition to any wardrobe. warm but not hot. looks great with tights as a dress or with leggings. so many compliments.,Positive
22406,"I didn't think from the photo online that the sweater would be quite so sparkly & gold! it has gold weaved in - so if the sparkly isn't your thing, beware. the sweater fit well although i didn't feel the neckline was quite as clean as in the photo above. also, you'd have to be careful not to snag on jewelry. it's a thin sweater material that may require a camisole underneath depending on the weather.",Positive

22425,"I purchased the green online, in my usual medium. i do like it but i will be returning it for a few reasons. first, i couldn't justify the price as it's really not unique enough. it kind of reminds me of a pajama top. also, i thought it was 3/4 sleeve, which it is not, it's long sleeve. and lastly, it appears to be regular length on the model. i'm maybe 5'4 at best and it's shorter and boxy. i gave it 4 stars because i really like it for what it is, but just not what i expected. it is cute, spor",Positive

22451,"The design is gorgeous and the fabric feels great. not a lot of functionality, then again i did buy the kimono to feel sexy and not to keep warm! i ordered the xsmall/small and feel i should have ordered the med/large. unless you're super tiny/fit, i'd recommend sizing up here. i bet it would still be super flattering a touch larger!",Positive
22457,This has a very nice hang to it- combination of the cut and linen- like fabric. i liked it so much that i bought two different colors. so many tees are blousy and full now;i am short so they look like maternity tops. this one is much more flattering.,Positive

22467,"I have been looking for a fall/spring coat to wear when the weather is between 30 and 55 degrees. this ""coat"" looks great in the pictures, but so disappointing in reality. the best thing i can say is that the fabric is soft. it is unlined, so i'm not sure why you'd even wear it -- if the weather's warm enough to wear a thin, unlined jacket, why not just wear a sweater? the weight is not what i would expect at this price point. even worse, the design is terrible; my husband (who has a great eye)",Negative
22468,Visions of sartorial splendor danced in my head as i planned my instagram posts centered around this coat. and then it showed up on my door and my dreams were crushed. i'd already read the reviews and knew the coat was unlined and would be oversized. i did not expect it to be soooo sloppy. especially around the collar. there is nothing crisp about it. i've had boiled wool outer ware before that held its shape much better than this. if i wanted fleece i wouldn't have picked retailer as the s,Negative

22479,"I had my eye on this one for awhile and decided to buy it when it popped back on my wishlist. i can see why someone returned it. the sweater top hits at the worst possible spot and made me look ridiculous, like a mushroom top. from the side i saw the potential, but not enough to save it. probably one of the worst things i have ever purchased from retailer.",Negative
22481,Loved this sweater when i saw it online. when it arrived it had a very strong chemical smell to it and was very stiff textured. despite the dry clean only tag i decided to soak it overnight in woolite to soften it and get rid of the smell. the next day i rinsed it in cold water and block dried it outside. it still wreaked of chemicals and took three more subsequent washings to finally get rid of the smell. hand washing did not hurt it whatsoever fyi. it looks fab with jeans and is very comfy. i,Positive
22483,"I ordered these in m (5'8"" 140 lbs.) and they are tts: they fit well and are neither tight nor loose. the issue that i have with them (and the reason that i sent them back) is that the material, although comfortable, is completely transparent; if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these, the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless! furthermore, these are not white but off-white (and quite a yellowy off-white, at that), so these loungers don't look as cute with the feature",Negative

22493,"The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs, but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body, it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women.",Negative

22523,"The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however, the fabric, despite 2% spandex, has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4'), i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear, i think they would cut off the circulation.

22750,"Purchased it in raspberry. first time it came in the mail, it was stained and the hem looked like it had been dragged through the mud! come on customer service, you need to be more diligent about checking out items before you ship them! i ordered it again, and this time it was a new jumpsuit in plastic, so pristine. 
i am a size 8-10, and the small fit me fine. the lining is a little tight in the crotch area, but i can put up with it for the style of this jumpsuit!!",Positive
22752,"Terrible fit for a longer torso.  runs small in hip and lining, huge in the waist.  not good for an hourglass figure!",Negative
22753,"The reason i gave this an overall rating of 4 stars is because of the sizing. the jumpsuit runs big and the black does not have a petite option; otherwise, i would give this 5 stars. this jumpsuit is so gorgeous that i had to buy both colors. i bought the black in medium and it looks absolutely beautiful on but i will have to take it to get it altered; it is way too big on me. i really need a petite in this but i still bought the black and am getting it altered. 

i loved this jumpsuit so much",Positive
22761,I ordered this top because it was on a crazy sale and i'm really glad i did. it's super soft and comfortable but still very cute so its versatile. you can wear it down or dress it up with a great skirt or jacket.,Positive

22794,"I love this dress. i ordered the small, i am 5'2"" and 116ibs. the dress fell right at my knee cap. i had it altered in length 2"" and now it looks great. i was a little concerned about having to cut off some of the print design elements, but it didn't effect the look .",Positive

22801,"Loved the fabric of this dress, and the slip that comes with it. i wish the waist line fit a little better though. i am 5'4"" with an athletic build and it looked really boxy on me. i was so disappointed. thought i could synch it in to make it work, but think this is a return.",Positive
22803,"Couldn't make it work, even belted. ivory color is darker irl--dingy light tan, like dirty vintage. ""drop"" waist is not dropped at all, just a maternity-ish cut that starts boxy-loose high up (below bust), then abruptly flares out at bellybutton level (not low hip) into the skirt. i usually find a-line cuts good at giving illusion of a willowy, curvy waist, but this does not--adds ten pounds. poly fabric heavy/hot; rayon lining awkward and doesn't flow/drape. (5'3'' 127lb 34a, tried xs)",Negative
22810,"I'm 5'3"" about 130lbs and ordered a size 6. the print on the fabric is as expected but the shape of the dress and fit were not good at all. i probably would wear a 4 instead of the 6, but could tell that even if i had the 4, the cut of it still wouldn't be flattering on me at all. it was baggy in odd places and had no shape. the outer fabric is very sheer and see through and the lining is nice, with a fitted slip design.",Negative
22824,"1. i'm 5'6"" tall with a short waist and long legs, and this skirt came all the way down to my ankles. i would have kept it if it had stopped mid-calf like in the photo.

2. i'm 38-32-40 and the size 12 fit me perfectly in the waist hip area, so i would say it runs true to size.

3. the buttons lay nice and flat over the tummy, so that's a plus. at least you don't have to undo them to go to the bathroom.",Negative
22833,"Beautiful 100% lambswool sweater with all these gorgeous fall colors arranged into an eye catching design. i agree with reviewer numero uno, she is correct on all counts: pretty colors, quality construction, ultra long bell sleeves (look at model wearing cedar/neutral colorway), oversized fit. sizing down will still have those ridiculously long sleeves but i'm fine with that. i ordered size m and will exchange for a s as the cardigan is too large overall. wool is soft and just a bit itchy which",Positive
22835,"I love this coat. i bought it in 2012, and it still looks great in 2015. i only wear it a few times each season, but it makes me smile. it's tailored, feminine, and a bit flashy. it's fairly warm, too.",Positive
22839,"So much prettier in person than online. the animal print isn't in your face, but subtle enough for almost any occasion. the button-up collar and slightly past knee length make it work for a casual work environment. the pleats and airiness of the dress remind me of kate middleton in anita dongre. 

fit: 5'4"", 140 pounds - i bought a six, but the four would probably work as well. because of the lightness of the fabric, the extra fabric doesn't overwhelm my small frame. goes slightly past my knee",Positive
22844,Had to return. ordered an xs which usually fits perfect. 34b chest and it was falling off. shoulders and chest!! it was like a sleeping bag. huge fan of retailer but there is a design flaw in this sweater.,Negative
22856,The model looks like she's 14 years old - this sweater of course would fit a younger teen. it definitely won't work for a grown woman. please make some longer sweaters.,Negative
22866,This sweater did not flatter a sz 12 with 36d chest. it's very well made but not for the curvy girl. this is my very first review and felt compelled to share my thoughts since i heavily rely on others' reviews before i purchase.,Negative
22873,These pants look nice and are comfortable but the quality of the fabric is terrible! i should not be surprised because i bought another pair of pants by this same label at antro earlier this year and they did not hold up at all either. but i thought i'd give it another shot. never again! i'm on my 5th wear and the crotch and inner thighs have worn away completely...i mean huge holes in the fabric where it's just disintegrated. even at extra % off the sale price it's not worth it. the full price,Negative
22874,"This is simply a fabulous dress. i think the issue with the other reviewers is that they are too small (though there is nothing wrong with that). i am not. i am older and heavier, and the dress fits very well. i'm also rounder on the bottom so it is not baggy or tent-like. the material and texture of the yarn is soft and comfortable. you can wear it all day at the office and into the evening. it looks great with a jean jacket, for example, and booties. and it also looks terrific with flats. it d",Positive
22879,"It is rare that i find a pair of pants that works for me at retailer. as a woman with curves i have found that most of retailer's pants are cut for slim figured women, this rare pair of pants crosses the divide, flattering both shapes. i usually have to look for xls. here, i found that i had too much room and sized down to a l. these pants are great. they are lightweight without being so gauzy that they highlight imperfections. they will be my go to summer pant. i love them.",Positive
22885,"Bummer, i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen. seriously looks maternity to me. the neck is also too wide. the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didn't work on me. i returned this one.",Negative
22886,"These pants are so great, light, comfortable and reasonably priced. they are very well made, and the soft fabric is perfect for summer traveling and hiking. there's a bit of elastic in the waist which i like since pants usually gap at the waist on me. they're like classier lounge pants.",Positive
22888,Good reason to read reviews. i concur with others in that it fins large and looks boxy. heavy fabric makes matters worse.,Negative
22892,"I was looking for something business casual when i ran into this dress in store. i was able to wear a petite small, but am normally a 4-6 in dresses. it does run large! its perfect with heels for work or dressed down with boots in the fall. it is very comfortable and still looks like you're trying.",Positive
22907,I purchased the pale green in this sweater first. loved it so much i purchased in another color.,Positive
22916,"I already have some dresses similar to this, but i couldn't help getting this one, too. i love the flowers, bees, and ladybugs on the print! there is some shimmery beading on the neck and a few spots. i think i can wear this at work with the right cardigan/jacket, so i'll get more use out of it. it's a lovely light, floaty fabric that's nice for warmer weather.",Positive
22919,Beautiful sweater. i first bought it in black and loved it so much i bought it in burgundy. the burgundy one is longer and slightly bigger than the black one and they are both smalls. nice thing is i can wear the burgundy one with leggings. love the lace on the sleeves and the sweater is a nice weight.,Positive
22923,"Loved everything about this sweater but the short length.  didn't notice in the pictures but the last one of the back of the model shows the length. it barely reached the very top of my jeans so would have to wear something under or i'd be flashing my stomach all the time.  worked a bit better with skirts, but still too cropped for my frame. wish it was 1-2"" longer in length and would have been a new fall favorite. really great color and design besides that. just make sure you are wanting the sh",Positive
22929,"I bought this duster in the blue color and really like it. i am 5'11"" so love the longer length. the large was too wide so got the medium. the sleeves were a little snug on my upper arms but after wearing it for awhile they loosened up. i think i will get the white too!",Positive
22937,This is another item i've been stalking that i thought miraculously made it to sale with my size still available. i ordered online but when it arrived i have to be honest i didn't even try it on because i knew it would be going back. the beautiful print online looks really cheap irl on the flimsy fabric. the beaded detail on neck is basically a low grade sequin trim. so much potential just executed poorly.,Negative
22939,"The sleeves on this top always caught my eye every single time i was in a store. they never had my size to try on, so when a free shipping offer came up, i ordered the ivory top in a size large. well, the sleeves are indeed stunning, but that is all that is attractive about this top! the rest was a plain, blank, white canvas. in fact, that's what it felt like to wear it -- like i was wearing a tent or an artist's canvas on my chest. yuck! how can this designer put so much thought and care into t",Negative
22940,"I went with my usual size, but it is too tight, it fits, but i would feel uncomfortable in it. i ordered the pink one, which looks nice in the picture, but in person, it looks cheap. the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the 1970s. that beaded neckline added to the cheap look. this one is not for me.",Negative
22942,"I just bought this and i really disagree with previous review that it runs big - i wear an 8 in skirts and bought another retailer skirt last week that fits just fine - this one does not even zip up. i might exchange for bigger size, as label is just a number to me and sizes are really inconsistent - or it may just go back.",Negative
22944,"Purchased this in-store today. i'm normally a small, but tried on x-small before trying on my regular size. the x-small fit perfectly. i'm 5""5, 135 lbs, with wide hips and petite derriã¨re. the dress fit well, slightly hugging my bottom. while i don't like things that draw attention to my bottom, with an outward tug or two of the stretchy material of the dress, it fit perfectly. sweater dresses tend to be bulky, so it makes sense to down size. definitely a nice addition to my closet.",Positive
22949,"I have an athletic body 5'6"". i have no curves and this dress made me look so feminine and long and lean. on top of it being beautiful , the dress has a very comfortable ""jersey knit type"" lining. so easy to wear and incredibly comfortable sitting and /or dancing.",Positive
22952,I can not imagine the cut in the waist being flattering on anyone. i ordered an xs and an xxs still would have flared too much in the waste. i ignored the previous review and that was a huge mistake!,Negative
22958,"I bought the red motiff in my usual size of xxs petite and it was huge. at first i thought they had mistakenly sent the wrong size but this was sadly not the case. the fit is definitely ""sack-like"" as other reviewers mentioned. i had to return.",Negative
22964,"Dress appears to be slim fit, but that's far from the case. usually wear an xs regular because i have a long torso for my 5'3"", but it just hung on me like a heavy sack. i have a hard time finding dresses now that i'm not working and like to have a couple on hand for all purpose occasions--weddings, memorials, special occasions. i hoped this one would meet my needs. disappointed.",Negative
22969,"This is a beautiful knit dress, however it runs large, so be wary. for reference i am a 34d, 28 inch waist, and 41 inch hips. i ordered a medium because dresses usually run tight around my bum, and it was very, very big. i'm hoping the small is much more flattering because the quality of the knit is very nice.",Positive

22975,"I loved these pants and purchased them in three colors. like another reviewer, within a few weeks, having worn them no more than a couple of times, the fabric in the crotch area started to wear thin and two pairs developed holes. i was not hard on the pants - just wore them to the office - and line dried them. so disappointing, as i really did love the pants. total waste of money.",Negative

the fabric is on the lighter side, however for me that is a double plus.
it is great for layering with a cami underneath and/or a heavier sweater on top.

23061,Very cute top but it is wide and runs large. it is very flattering with skinny jeans and the color is a beautiful navy almost a hint of purple. i would consider a size down. may run on the short side for those with longer torsos.,Positive
23062,"I love this top! it's well-made (important if you're in chlorine or salt water) and has vibrant colors. the back strap has two clasp options, so not much room for adjustment but i like this fastening method because you don't have a big bow to lay on when laying out.",Positive
23063,This sweater/jacket is great over any blouses. love the color. it looks more slightly peachy cream color that i love! goes with everything. warm. i thought it ran true to size. i ordered a small and love the way it fits. if you are looking for more of an oversized piece then you would need to size up.,Positive

23213,"Based on the mixed reviews about fit, i waited to purchase until i could try it on in the store and was not disappointed. i'm wondering if there are different batches of this dress? i'm 5'7 and the dress fit as in the photo. the side slits come above my knees but not too high. arm holes are a bit large so if you want more coverage this may not be for you. the material is cozy and soft. the cream color is gorgeous. size wise, it definitely looks boxy and marshmallow-like if too loose. i am usuall",Positive
23216,"I wanted to love this dress, however it has no shape to it. it is also somewhat see through, so something needs to be worn under it. i feel like i received a dress that has been stretched out and returned. i'm extremely disappointed. i do not recommend.",Negative
23217,"I'm usually wary of light colored knits because they can often be thin and see through, but this one had nothing for me to worry about. this had an adequate thickness which does not leave me freezing and i did not consider it sheer. i find that the sleeveless turtleneck design can be versatile for the seasons. i plan to wear it with a cropped denim jacket and boots for colder days and sandals on warmer days. the material is very soft. the cut is true to size to large. i went true to size because",Positive
23221,"This dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it. i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available. the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed. however, the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky. i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering.",Negative
23222,This trench coat is the best fit and feel-true to size and cozy! excellent material!,Positive
23225,"I thought this dress looked gorgeous on the model. so floaty and light. when it came, i found it to be the exact opposite. the hem is so heavy and laid on me like a potato sack. it had way too much material at the bottom and weighed me down unfortunately.",Negative
23240,"Very comfortable, flattering, washes nicely- love it!",Positive
23245,"This is my favorite pair so far from cartonnier. the side zip dresses up the pants which is something i was looking for and i just love the print. so happy with the quality, i ordered a second pair. fit true to size for me. i plan to wear them with knee high boots as it gets colder.",Positive
23255,"Pants are overpriced and very uncomfortable. to my utter dismay i wore them during a business trip for the first time and ended up with bruises caused by the side zipper. i have been a long time retailer shopper and usually my go to store, however,ending up with a pair of pants that caused me pain was a very big disappointment,",Negative
23266,"I discovered this top folded on a shelf and loved the material and this brand so i decided to try it on... even though it's super hot right now in ar. i'm so glad i did and ended up finding the other color and buying both. i am 5'9"", 127#, 34b and long waisted. it is difficult to tell in the pictures how this top fits around the waist... it is snug fitting but the material is thicker so i feel like it's very flattering. i tried it on as a boat neck look, then saw online it was off the shoulder a",Positive
23274,"I'm 5'7"" 155lbs and ordered a large. it fit, but the arms were awkwardly short. the finish details on the end of each sleeve almost would have to be pushed back to the elbow for it to look right, which would be okay. however, the interior seam of the neckline is cut jaggedly and isn't even finished with any stitching. it's just tucked haphazardly inside the neckline and isn't sewn--it would unravel with washing. 

it's soft and snuggly and cute if you get it on super-sale and don't mind it com",Negative
23275,Love this top! off the shoulder fits great! little extra room around the torso than i'd love... but still absolutely in love with this top! the black lace detail on the bottom is amazing! love the colors for fall! ordered a small and i'm 5'9 138lbs and i ordered a small,Positive
23278,"This skirt is the perfect flirty denim piece for the summer.   it's light weight but good quality.   the only draw back is the waist is quite fitted when zipped.   had to size up.    it's like a pencil skirt on top, which does make it tough to tuck anything in unless it's very thin.   overall, charming skirt.   do love.",Positive
23282,"So after reading the 2 reviews, decided to just order my usual size (26), thinking they might be a tad snug. wrong! they were huge! i looked at the size to see if they sent me a size 30 by mistake! unfortunately small sizes sold out. quality is excellent as well as style, so bummed!",Negative
23287,"This is a gorgeous print, but i found it too fussy for my taste.  it is quite shapeless so i tried doing a half tuck. it looked cute for about 2 seconds, but then i had to worry about keeping the shoulders down.",Negative
23297,"Love the way these pants fit. love the length. love the cut! just the right amount of flare... normally i am a 28 or 29 in citizens jeans. i considered the 27 in them, but the legs were a bit tight. 28 was just about perfect. and the best part....they are finally on sale. i look forward to wearing them with flats or heels and a simple white shirt!",Positive
23313,"I love this style. reminds me of what we used to wear back in the 70's. it's very cute, flattering, and material is a high quality. will look good with skinny or boot cut jeans. if you like this ""baby doll"" style, you'll love this.",Positive
23318,The adjustable tie is really nice and adds a nice style twist to a black suit.,Positive
23320,"I love the look of this dress but it runs very large. i am 5'2 110lbs. i ordered the extra small on sale & got a killer deal on it. i intended to use it as a beach cover up since it's sheer, but when i tried it on i felt like i was wearing a mumu. even for the price & for the beach i am going to return it. i'm sad because it is a beautiful cover-up and for what it is i think the quality is good.",Negative
23348,"I've been looking for a nice summer maxi dress and after reading some positive reviews, i decided to get the dress. the fabric is soft and has a nice flow to it. however, i had to return the dress because the cuff of the sleeve was too tight on my forearm, which make it impossible for me to raise my arms.

i ordered size petite xxs",Negative
23351,"Love everything about this dress except for the elastic waistband. it's a dressier style, and the elastic cheapens the look--definitely needs a ribbon or belt to cover. otherwise the cut and fit is very flattering, the fabric is nice, and the floral pattern is lovely. i found the dress tts (size 4r and i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs).",Positive
23352,"I loved the print and fabric of this dress when i first saw it, but trying it on was a very different story! the photo seems to show a wider, more well-defined waist, with just a small amount of ""blousing"" on top, but this was not the case. yes, the waist fit, but it is a narrow band that was covered completely by the hanging over of the ill-fitting top, turning the entire look into a shapeless and very unattractive fit. sadly, this is going right back!",Negative
23375,"I love this dress but i will return it because the sleeves are too tight. i have never had this problem before. i ordered a petite 0 and petite 2. for reference i am 5' 4"" tall and 117 lbs. the length is perfect and i really like the style. if the sleeves had not been so tight i would have kept the petite 0. the petite 2 sleeves were no looser. sorry that this did not work for me.",Negative
23378,"Being 5 ft, long/maxi dresses are usually not what i buy, but i tried this dress on and it was the perfect length for me. i wear size 2 or 4 and i tried on both sizes in store. the 4 i tried on had a shorter length for some reason than the 2 (maybe it was a petite and was mislabeled?). i ended up getting the 4 and i love the dress!",Positive
23385,"Soft florals on light as air chiffon layers--what's not to like on this romantic dress?  i appreciate the elastic waist and the tie at the back of the neck, as it gives me flexibility during my weight fluctuations.  my only regret is that i'm too darn short for regular length and will have to wear platforms since the back of the hem drags on my 5'3"" self.  purchased the size 8 and i am 140# 36dd.",Positive
23389,"I so wanted to love this top. i ordered the ""blue"", which is blue and orange. i thought the orange would be brighter, it is not. it is a dull color. also, i'm usually a medium, this top fits fine on my shoulders/bust 34c, but it was huge around the waist, making me look a lot larger. if this top were a bit smaller around the waist, i would keep it, but it is going back.",Negative
23390,"Unfortunately, this dress did not work for me like the other reviews. i am 5'8, 130lbs, and the dress looked like a tent on me (size s). there was just way too much material at the bottom. also, while the dress is lined, both layers are quite thin- not see through, but i would not call them substantial either. for the cost of the dress and the material, it wasn't worth paying more to have it tailored to fit better.",Negative
23391,"The model looks awesome in this cute top, but on me it looked boxy but was too tight around the chest and was too short (for reference, i'm 5'7,"" 140 lbs., and 34c). the front is non-stretchy eyelet lace cotton fabric, yet the back is stretchy. in theory, it's pretty, but in reality it doesn't work - at least for me. i think it might work for someone petite with a smaller chest.",Negative
23393,I love this dress so much. absolutely beautiful true to the size. since i start wearing it i got so many good compliment. the flowers is very spring and summary. very sexy to the bottom....,Positive
23405,"I'm petite, and i knew buying this that it would be a big sweater - that is the look that is portrayed on the model. the sweater is scratchy, the neck was so big and bulky i had trouble making it lay right. it looks great on the model here, but not on me. going back. so bummed. the color gray is true to what is shown and it has little ""holes"" or openings across the shoulders. so there is a tiny bit of detail. overall, not a great sweater.",Negative
23406,"I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer. for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses. the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all. the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown. this dress has no shape to it, although probably comfortable, not flattering. i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture, in person.",Negative
23407,"This dress is very flattering, comfortable and made me feel pretty!",Positive
23408,I love this dress but it definitely runs big. i bought a size small and i'm between a 4 and a 6 and will have to return for an xs. the top feels like it will fall down and i'm a size 34c,Positive
23414,The front and back materials differ. the back of the shirt is soft and thin. the front embroidery is stiff but i imagine it will soften after a wash. pretty shirt though.,Positive
23417,Can i tell you this top is amazing?! get it quick before it sells out!!,Positive
23424,Before i ordered this i noted the other reviews that said it was sheer but thought i would just wear a layer underneath. unfortunately it was one of the sheerest fabrics i've ever seen. would love it if it could have been a more substantial fabric. to me it wasn't worth the money even on sale.,Negative
23426,Absolutely love this shirt - the embroidery on the front is beautiful. gold and silver metallic thread with good quality. very slim fit through the torso with loose sleeves. the only downside is the cream material is very sheer - definitely have to wear a tank underneath.,Positive
23427,"What drew me to this shirt was the beautiful silver and gold embroidery on the front. the shirt was folded at the store, which makes sense because if it were hung it up, fewer people would try it on. this shirt is sheer from the front and more sheer in the back. this is what bugs me about so many ""clothes"" that are made these days: they are so cheaply made, so thin with cloth, that you are forced to layer with a camisole or something else in order to wear it in public. i can't wear sheer clothes",Negative
23437,"This dress is so cute in the photo and fit true to size, but the material is slinky and felt cheap. the stitching was also poor quality. i am so thankful that retailer will let us order a batch, try on and return in store...this went back.",Negative
23442,"Love this dress, very flattering fit and the fabric does not feel heavy but is sturdy - i wore it for first dinner out with my husband after losing most of my baby weight and felt great and confident in it.",Positive
23444,"As per usual bordeaux is perfect with this cardigan. very soft, washes well. love it.",Positive
23456,"I have been on a search for a dress with sleeves that cute enough for date night. as a bigger girl than most retailer reviewers, i was happy to find this covered my ample chest and between the crosswrap and a little flare in the skirt it camoflauges my belly. it is a sweater dress, which is not easily noticable in the web photos, and can certainly be dressed up for a dinner or for the office.",Positive
23463,"These pants overall are very comfortable, but have an unusual fit. they tend to run a bit short, and i always have to get pants hemmed shorter, so if you have long legs or like more draping, you probably won't like these. they also ran a bit large in the waist and thigh, a bit puffy, i had to size down in order to get a good fit. very good quality, and cute design.",Positive
23464,I wore this dress to work the other day and got so many compliments on the fit and the design - the wrap on the top. i got it in grey and it's a beautiful color for winter. the dress is very comfortable to wear.,Positive
23466,"This dress has a great design and fits very well and looks great. although the material is not cheap it is very warm and doesn't breath very well which is good in the winter. the only complaint i have is there was a small snag in it, but i was able to fix it my self.",Positive
23474,"Yes, this is a great dress! i wasn't sure about it online because of the color combination. i think i would have preferred the gray color but it was sold out. it received very good reviews online so i thought it was worth the risk at the sale price. i am always on the hunt for great dresses at great prices (who isn't?!). once i received it and tried it on, oh wow! i love it. it is so flattering. it is a very pretty dress. i think i will wear this all the time. i am actually thinking of all the d",Positive
23478,I was surprised at the positive reviews for this product. its terrible! it cuts you in a weird place to make you look wide. the skirt is also not like the picture. its darker and heavier. the material isnt great. i had to return.,Negative
